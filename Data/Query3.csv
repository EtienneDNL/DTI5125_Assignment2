The spread of such myths and half-truths can be amplified by the widespread use of AI in the acquisition of marketing knowledge. Thus, the aim of this paper will be to use a few selected AI tools to obtain answers to selected marketing questions and compare these with each other. Subsequently, the answers will be compared with the findings of empirical research addressing the issues. In a comparative analysis between artificial intelligence tools and scholarly literature, no significant disparities were identified. Artificial intelligence does not strive to present unequivocal conclusions but emphasizes the necessity of drawing insights from diverse sources.

Real-world examples of organizations who are using AI in digital marketing abound. For example, Red Balloon and Harley Davidson used AI to automate their digital advertising campaigns. However, we are early in the process of both the practical application of AI by firms broadly and by their marketing functions in particular. One could argue that we are even earlier in the research process of conceptualizing, theorizing, and researching the use and impact of AI. Importantly, as with most technologies of significant potential, the application of AI in marketing engenders not just practical considerations but ethical questions as well. The ability of AI to automate activities, that in the past people did, also raises the issue of whether marketing professionals will embrace AI as a means to free them from more mundane tasks to spend time on higher value activities, or will they view AI as a threat to their employment? Given the nascent nature of research on AI at this point, the full capabilities and limitations of AI in marketing are unknown.

This research systematically compares the performance of AI-generated to human-made marketing images across important marketing dimensions. First, we prompt seven stateof-the-art generative text-to-image models (DALL-E 3, Midjourney v6, Firefly 2, Imagen 2, Imagine, Stable Diffusion XL Turbo, and Realistic Vision) to create 10 320 synthetic marketing images, using 2 400 real-world, human-made images as input. 254 400 human evaluations of these images show that AI-generated marketing imagery can surpass human-made images in quality, realism, and aesthetics. Second, we give identical creative briefings to commissioned human freelancers and the AI models, showing that the best synthetic images also excel in ad creativity, ad attitudes, and prompt following. Third, a field study with more than 173 000 impressions demonstrates that AI-generated banner ads can compete with professional human-made stock photography, achieving an up to 50 gest that the paradigm shift brought about by generative AI can help advertisers produce marketing content not only faster and orders of magnitude cheaper but also at superhuman effectiveness levels with important implications for firms, consumers, and policymakers.

This study examines the potential of AI-driven methodologies, specifically K-means clustering and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), in designing impactful marketing strategies. Using the Mall Customer Dataset, which includes consumer attributes like gender, age, annual income, and spending scores, this research develops a segmentation framework enriched with additional features, such as purchasing behavior during specific events, individual preferences, and demographic norms. K-means clustering is employed to group customers into meaningful segments based on shared behavioral patterns, with the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score ensuring optimal cluster determination. To enhance the interpretability of clustering results, LIME is used to explain the influence of demographic and behavioral factors on cluster formation. This explainability enables marketing teams to understand the rationale behind customer segmentation, promoting transparency and ethical AI usage. By integrating AI-driven segmentation with explainable AI, the framework offers deeper customer insights while aligning strategies with diverse consumer values. The approach empowers businesses to craft ethical and personalized marketing campaigns tailored to unique consumer needs. This study not only supports more effective engagement strategies but also emphasizes the importance of transparency in AI-driven marketing, fostering trust and alignment with consumer expectations. Actionable recommendations are provided for businesses aiming to enhance market presence and create impactful, tailored campaigns that resonate with their audience. The proposed K-Means-LIME framework achieved superior performance with an MSE of 0.9212 and an MAE of 0.9874, demonstrating its effectiveness in delivering precise and interpretable customer segmentation insights.",,,,,"Zoirov, Ulmas/LFU-7219-2024; Prof. Ts.

This study examines the factors influencing AI adoption by companies, focusing on the perspectives of CEOs. Using a survey of 409 senior executives from Spanish firms, this research develops an advanced framework based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), enriched with additional constructs. The findings reveal that effort expectancy and facilitating conditions are critical drivers of AI adoption. AI aversion, reflecting concerns about distrust, complexity, and ethical risks, emerges as a significant barrier, particularly for CEOs of smaller firms, where its impact is notably stronger. Relative advantage and perceived value also influence adoption intentions, albeit to a lesser degree, indicating the perceived benefits and tangible outcomes of AI in improving processes such as segmentation, automation, and predictive analytics. Key differences arise between companies of varying revenue sizes: smaller firms exhibit greater aversion to AI, whereas larger organisations focus on maximizing their strategic benefits to drive innovation. These insights highlight the importance of tailored approaches, such as financial incentives, pilot programs, and targeted training, to reduce aversion and encourage adoption across diverse organizational contexts. This study contributes to the academic discourse by extending the UTAUT framework to address emerging challenges in AI adoption. Practically, it provides actionable strategies for business leaders to address human-centric and technological barriers, fostering a more efficient and data-driven marketing process.

J,"Kumar, D; Suthar, N",,,,"Kumar, Dinesh; Suthar, Nidhi",,,Ethical and legal challenges of AI in marketing: an exploration of solutions,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & ETHICS IN SOCIETY,,,,,,,,,,,,"PurposeArtificial intelligence (AI) has sparked interest in various areas, including marketing. However, this exhilaration is being tempered by growing concerns about the moral and legal implications of using AI in marketing. Although previous research has revealed various ethical and legal issues, such as algorithmic discrimination and data privacy, there are no definitive answers. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating AI's ethical and legal concerns in marketing and suggesting feasible solutions.Design/methodology/approachThe paper synthesises information from academic articles, industry reports, case studies and legal documents through a thematic literature review. A qualitative analysis approach categorises and interprets ethical and legal challenges and proposes potential solutions.FindingsThe findings of this paper raise concerns about ethical and legal challenges related to AI in the marketing area. Ethical concerns related to discrimination, bias, manipulation, job displacement, absence of social interaction, cybersecurity, unintended consequences, environmental impact, privacy and legal issues such as consumer security, responsibility, liability, brand protection, competition law, agreements, data protection, consumer protection and intellectual property rights are discussed in the paper, and their potential solutions are discussed.Research limitations/implicationsNotwithstanding the interesting insights gathered from this investigation of the ethical and legal consequences of AI in marketing, it is important to recognise the limits of this research. Initially, the focus of this study is confined to a review of the most important ethical and legal issues pertaining to AI in marketing. Additional possible repercussions, such as those associated with intellectual property, contracts and licencing, should be investigated more deeply in future studies. Despite the fact that this study gives various answers and best practices for tackling the stated ethical and legal concerns, the viability and efficacy of these solutions may differ depending on the context and industry. Thus, more research and case studies are required to evaluate the applicability and efficacy of these solutions in other circumstances. This research is mostly based on a literature review and may not represent the experiences or opinions of all stakeholders engaged in AI-powered marketing. Further study might involve interviews or surveys with marketing professionals, customers and other key stakeholders to offer a full knowledge of the practical difficulties and solutions. Because of the rapid speed of technical progress, AI's ethical and regulatory ramifications in marketing are continually increasing. Consequently, this work should be a springboard for more research and continuing conversations on this subject.Practical implicationsThis study's findings have several practical implications for marketing professionals. Emphasising openness and explainability: Marketing professionals should prioritise transparency in their use of AI, ensuring that customers are fully informed about data collection and utilisation for targeted advertising. By promoting openness and explainability, marketers can foster customer trust and avoid the negative consequences of a lack of transparency. Establishing ethical guidelines: Marketing professionals need to develop ethical rules for the creation and implementation of AI-powered marketing strategies. Adhering to ethical principles ensures compliance with legal norms and aligns with the organisation's values and ideals. Investing in bias detection tools and privacy-enhancing technology: To mitigate risks associated with AI in marketing, marketers should allocate resources to develop and implement bias detection tools and privacy-enhancing technology. These tools can identify and address biases in AI algorithms, safeguard consumer privacy and extract valuable insights from consumer data.Social implicationsThis study's social implications emphasise the need for a comprehensive approach to address the ethical and legal challenges of AI in marketing. This includes adopting a responsible innovation framework, promoting ethical leadership, using ethical decision-making frameworks and conducting multidisciplinary research. By incorporating these approaches, marketers can navigate the complexities of AI in marketing responsibly, foster an ethical organisational culture, make informed ethical decisions and develop effective solutions. Such practices promote public trust, ensure equitable distribution of benefits and risk, and mitigate potential negative social consequences associated with AI in marketing.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is among the first to explore potential solutions comprehensively.

This is why building an appropriate marketing and exploitation strategy is fundamental in achieving the desired economic impacts of AILP operation and exploitation, and for financial decisions concerning further AILP development. This paper presents the methods and final outcomes of collaborative roadmapping as part of an exploitation and marketing strategy and user community building plan for an AILP implemented within a recent Horizon 2020 project. Platform marketing activities have a hierarchical structure. They touch upon the platform as a whole, the platform as a learning tool for its users, as well as may aim at licensing some of its stand-alone software components.

Design/methodology/approach Across two empirical studies, the authors examine the efficacy of AI social media influencers. With Study 1, the authors establish baseline effects for AI influencers and investigate how social-psychological distance impacts consumer perceptions. The authors also investigate the role of an influencer's agency - being autonomous or externally managed - to test the boundaries of the results and determine the interactive effects between influencer type and influencer agency. Study 2 acts as an extension and validation of Study 1, whereby the authors provide generalisability and overlay the role of need for uniqueness as a moderated mediator. Findings The authors show that there are similarities and differences in the ways in which consumers view AI and human influencers. Importantly, the authors find no difference in terms of intention to follow or personalisation. This suggests that consumers are equally open to follow an AI or human influencer, and they perceive the level of personalisation provided by either influencer type as similar. Furthermore, while an AI influencer is generally perceived as having lower source trust, they are more likely to evoke word-of-mouth intentions. In understanding these effects, the authors show that social distance mediates the relationship between influencer type and the outcomes the authors investigate. Results also show that AI influencers can have a greater effect on consumers who have a high need for uniqueness. Finally, the authors find that a lack of influencer agency has a detrimental effect. Research limitations/implications The studies investigate consumers' general response to AI influencers within the context of Instagram, however, future research might examine consumers' response to posts promoting specific products across a variety of category contexts and within different social media platforms. Practical implications The authors find that in some ways, an AI influencer can be as effective as a human influencer. Indeed, the authors suggest that there may be a spill-over effect from consumer experiences with other AI recommendation systems, meaning that consumers are open to AI influencer recommendations. However, the authors find consistent evidence that AI influencers are trusted less than traditional influencers, hence the authors caution brands from rushing to replace human influencers with their AI counterparts. Originality/value This paper offers novel insight into the increasingly prominent phenomenon of the AI influencer. Specifically, it takes initial steps towards developing understanding as to how consumers respond to AI influencers and contrast these effects with human influencers.",,,,,"Sands, Sean/KQT-9307-2024; Plangger, Kirk/P-7532-2018","Sands, Sean/0000-0001-9192-3676; Plangger, Kirk/0000-0002-0354-9707",,,,,,,,,,,,,0309-0566,1758-7123,,,,JUN 7,2022,56,6,,,SI,,1721,1747,,10.1108/EJM-12-2019-0949,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJM-12-2019-0949,,FEB 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000759297800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, research based on real-life practitioner data is limited in this domain. The present study addresses this research gap with a two-pronged approach: one, using grey-DEMATAL, it quantitatively evaluates the impact of AI on contemporary marketing; and two, it establishes industry validation to the driving factors of AI in marketing derived from the extant research. The scope of the study was limited to financial services. The results indicate that enhancing customer experience by personalization at scale, increasing marketing efficiency, and driving positive brand engagement were the most powerful causal factors driving the adoption of AI in marketing.

Marketers have used AI for many years, but generative AI has only recently come to the forefront. The study focussed on understanding the beliefs and adoption of AI in content marketing practices in South Africa. Objectives: By combining various perspectives in the marketing industry, a taxonomy is proposed that categorises current AI practices in content marketing. Method: An exploratory web-based survey was adopted. It was important to measure the scope and extent of beliefs, acceptance, and adoption of AI in content marketing, and to gain insights to categorise current AI practices in content marketing. Data analyses of the closed- ended and open-ended questions were conducted using JMP (R), 17.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 2023) and through inductive thematic analysis, respectively. Results: The findings reveal that South African marketing agencies currently adopt AI for content strategy optimisation, content creation enhancement, insight integration and personalisation, automation and process enhancement. Conclusion: While South African marketing agencies acknowledge the value of AI in improving content marketing, they believe that the human element is still necessary, and that content marketing practice cannot depend entirely on AI.

The acquisition of diverse information has led to a diversification in consumer preferences and requirements. As consumer preferences diversify and online channels expand, there is an increasing need for companies to provide personalized marketing. Among the means of personalized marketing, personalized marketing messages are a key tool that can enhance customer engagement. However, a limitation of personalized marketing message services is the cost issue associated with manually writing individual marketing messages for personalization. To solve this problem, when developing automated technology for personalized marketing messages, there were concerns about the complexity of model development and the quality of messages generated automatically. In this study, we propose the Persuasive Message Intelligence (PMI) service, which utilizes the recently prominent Large Language Model for automated individual personalized marketing messages. PMI generates marketing messages through prompt engineering based on the theory of persuasion in marketing and prior research on AI-generated messages, and validates the elements of prompts through surveys. The trial and error of researchers presented in this study, along with the know-how and rules of prompt engineering, will serve as guidelines for those who wish to develop services through prompts in the future.",,,,,"Lee, Gun-Ho/AAB-7957-2022; Lee, Kyoung/KIE-2557-2024; Kim, Taekyung/JDX-0821-2023","Lee, Kyoung Jun/0000-0002-7774-6551; Kim, Taekyung/0000-0001-5089-2914; Lee, GUNHO/0009-0009-6000-1674; , Baek/0000-0003-4499-5583",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-3536,,,,,,2024,12,,,,,,22394,22402,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3361946,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3361946,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001171511800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this research, the authors conduct a multipronged analysis, including a review of marketing course syllabi, a survey of marketing educators, and follow-up qualitative interviews. Building on role theory and the community of inquiry model, they propose that GAI can assume three roles in marketing education: tutor, teammate, and tool. Each role influences teaching, social, and cognitive presence differently, shaping the learning experience and preparing workplace-ready marketing graduates. For instance, as a tutor, GAI can aid students in grasping theoretical concepts, while as a teammate, it can foster collaboration by supporting brainstorming and problem-solving activities. However, ethical considerations such as data privacy, plagiarism, dependency on AI, and fairness in assessment must be addressed to ensure its responsible adoption in marketing education.

In this paper, we review and call for marketing research to leverage machine learning methods. We provide an overview of common machine learning tasks and methods, and compare them with statistical and econometric methods that marketing researchers traditionally use. We argue that machine learning methods can process large-scale and unstructured data, and have flexible model structures that yield strong predictive performance. Meanwhile, such methods may lack model transparency and interpretability. We discuss salient AI-driven industry trends and practices, and review the still nascent academic marketing literature which uses machine learning methods. More importantly, we present a unified conceptual framework and a multi-faceted research agenda. From five key aspects of empirical marketing research: method, data, usage, issue, and theory, we propose a number of research priorities, including extending machine learning methods and using them as core components in marketing research, using the methods to extract insights from large-scale unstructured, tracking, and network data, using them in transparent fashions for descriptive, causal, and prescriptive analyses, using them to map out customer purchase journeys and develop decision-support capabilities, and connecting the methods to human insights and marketing theories.

With the rapid advancement of digital technologies, online advertising has become essential for eff ective brand communication with target audiences in digital spaces. Problem Statement. It has been hypothesized that artificial intelligence (AI) tools can enhance the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, leading to increased sales, higher profits for advertisers, and improved returns on marketing investments. Purpose. This study aims to examine the impact of AI tools on managing consumer behavior in digital marketing. Material and Methods. An experiment has been conducted on the Meta Ads platform to compare the outcomes of advertising campaigns confi gured with AI tools versus manual settings. Two test groups of advertising campaigns have been selected based on the competence and awareness of the management targets. Using Kohonen maps, the reflexive characteristics of the management targets in these groups have been assessed. By employing both manual settings and AI tools, an experiment has been carried out by a digital marketing specialist to modify potential customers' reflexive characteristics and investigate changes in their behavior regarding targeted actions within the advertising campaigns. Results have been compared across both configurations. Results. The study has shown that AI tools enable effective influence on user behavior in digital spaces. AI-gene rated recommendations have led to increased reach, clicks, and conversions from ad links, with the greatest efficiency observed when targeting potential customers.

By leveraging an official dataset sourced from the US government, the AI generates Python code to analyze the time interval between FDA approval dates and market release dates. The analysis identifies 370 manufacturers who achieved zero-day marketing-referring to drugs marketed immediately upon FDA approval-and 174 manufacturers who marketed their products within less than seven days of approval. Notably, 947 drug products were found to have been marketed prior to FDA approval, raising significant regulatory and ethical concerns that necessitate further discussion. The findings indicate that 174 drug manufacturers have the potential to optimize their marketing strategies to achieve zero-day timelines, prompting an examination of the feasibility of such acceleration within the current regulatory framework and its implications for industry practices.

Its speed of evolution requires that we adequately prepare students for an ever-changing landscape. Toward achieving that aim, we draw on the concept of interpretive flexibility, where the interpretations, uses, and outcomes of a new technology can differ and evolve over time, often with dominant stakeholders controlling the process. To engage marketing students in this process, we propose that they be presented with these diverse interpretations now as part of GenAI literacy. Specifically, we offer three small-scale pedagogical interventions designed to address this urgent need. Given the newness of GenAI, our interventions are designed to be infused into existing marketing instruction, instead of requiring a redesign of a curriculum. With each intervention, students not only significantly decrease their confidence in the accuracy of what GenAI produces but also see reasons to examine the implications of it. Both these outcomes, we suggest, could help to maintain interpretive flexibility required to properly respond to and guide the technology as its uses, impacts, and evolution become evident.

Design/methodology/approach The approach was to carry out a literature review and to consult with marketing experts who were invited to contribute to the paper. Findings There is little research into applying AI to strategic marketing decision-making. This research is needed, as the frontier of AI application to decision-making is moving in many management areas from operational to strategic. Given the competitive nature of such decisions and the insights from applying AI to defence and similar areas, it is time to focus on applying AI to strategic marketing decisions. Research limitations/implications The application of AI to strategic marketing decision-making is known to be taking place, but as it is commercially sensitive, data is not available to the authors. Practical implications There are strong implications for all businesses, particularly large businesses in competitive industries, where failure to deploy AI in the face of competition from firms, who have deployed AI to improve their decision-making could be dangerous. Social implications The public sector is a very important marketing decision maker. Although in most cases it does not operate competitively, it must make decisions about making different services available to different citizens and identify the risks of not providing services to certain citizens; so, this paper is relevant to the public sector.

Design/methodology/approach A review of the literature, documentation of sales and customer service experiences support the evolution of bot-driven consumer decision-making, proposing the bot-driven service platform as a key component of the service experience. Findings Today the focus is on convenience, the less time and effort, the better. The authors propose that AI has taken convenience to a new level for consumers. By using bots as their service of choice, consumers outsource their decisions to algorithms, hence give little attention to traditional consumer decision-making models and brand emphasis. At the moment, this is especially true for low involvement types of decisions, but high involvement decisions are on the cusp of delegating to AI. Therefore, management needs to change how they view consumers' decision-making-processes and how services are being managed. Research limitations/implications - In an AI-convenience driven service economy, the emphasis needs to be on search ranking or warehouse stock, rather than the traditional drivers of brand values such as service quality. Customer experience management will shift from interaction with products and services toward interactions with new service platforms such as AI, bots. Hence, service marketing, as the authors know it might be in decline and be replaced by an efficient complex attribute computer decision-making model.

A modern phenomenon is also the use of artificial intelligence, which helps marketers in various ways, such as creating content, texts, or evaluating metrics. The main objective of the paper is to identify whether there are statistically significant differences in the importance of shopping online via smartphone between men and women. The inspiration behind this paper stems from the current relevance of digital marketing and artificial intelligence, particularly the prevalent trend of online shopping through smartphones in the e-commerce domain. The survey, which targeted 194 respondents from Generation Y (Millennials), was conducted throughout the latter half of 2023. The findings suggest that, for most men, the significance of online shopping via smartphones is minimal. In contrast, it's noteworthy that online shopping via smartphones holds considerable importance for most women. The Mann-Whitney U-test validates the correlation between these variables. These results offer insights into the nuances of digital marketing and its influence on customer purchasing behaviour and decision-making. It is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic has instigated substantial shifts in people's buying patterns. Due to travel restrictions, people are increasingly drawn to purchasing items using mobile shopping apps instead of going to physical stores.

Its aim is to attract and engage target audiences through various strategies and methods, driving brand promotion and sales growth. The primary objective of this scholarly study is to seamlessly integrate advanced big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) technology into the realm of digital marketing, thereby fostering the progression and optimization of sustainable digital marketing practices. First, the characteristics and applications of big data involving vast, diverse, and complex datasets are analyzed. Understanding their attributes and scope of application is essential. Subsequently, a comprehensive investigation into AI-driven learning mechanisms is conducted, culminating in the development of an AI random forest model (RFM) tailored for sustainable digital marketing. Subsequent to this, leveraging a real-world case study involving enterprise X, fundamental customer data is collected and subjected to meticulous analysis. The RFM model, ingeniously crafted in this study, is then deployed to prognosticate the anticipated count of prospective customers for said enterprise. The empirical findings spotlight a pronounced prevalence of university-affiliated individuals across diverse age cohorts. In terms of occupational distribution within the customer base, the categories of workers and educators emerge as dominant, constituting 41% and 31% of the demographic, respectively. Furthermore, the price distribution of patrons exhibits a skewed pattern, whereby the price bracket of 0-150 encompasses 17% of the population, whereas the range of 150-300 captures a notable 52%. These delineated price bands collectively constitute a substantial proportion, whereas the range exceeding 450 embodies a minority, accounting for less than 20%. Notably, the RFM model devised in this scholarly endeavor demonstrates a remarkable proficiency in accurately projecting forthcoming passenger volumes over a seven-day horizon, significantly surpassing the predictive capability of logistic regression.

This manuscript evaluates how well Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides automated feedback on complex multimodal exercises requiring coding, statistics, and economic reasoning. Besides providing this technology through an easily accessible web application, this article evaluates the technology's performance by comparing the quantitative feedback (i.e., points achieved) from Generative AI models with human expert feedback for 4,349 solutions to marketing analytics exercises. The results show that automated feedback produced by Generative AI (GPT-4) provides almost unbiased evaluations while correlating highly with (r = 0.94) and deviating only 6 % from human evaluations. GPT-4 performs best among seven Generative AI models, albeit at the highest cost. Comparing the models' performance with costs shows that GPT-4, Mistral Large, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.0 Pro dominate three other Generative AI models (Claude 3 Sonnet, GPT-3.5, and Gemini 1.5 Pro). Expert assessment of the qualitative feedback (i.e., the AI's textual response) indicates that it is mostly correct, sufficient, and appropriate for learners. A survey of marketing analytics learners shows that they highly recommend the app and its Generative AI feedback. An advantage of the app is its subject-agnosticism-it does not require any subject- or exercise-specific training. Thus, it is immediately usable for new exercises in marketing analytics and other subjects. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about how potential candidates regard the use of AI as part of the recruitment process and whether or not it influences their likelihood to apply for a job. Our research finds that attitudes towards organizations that use AI in the recruitment process, significantly influences the likelihood that potential candidates will complete the application process. The novelty factor of using AI in the recruitment process, mediates and further positively influences job application likelihood. These positive relationships between attitudes towards the use of AI in the recruitment process and the likelihood of applying for a job have several important practical implications. First, it means that whilst anxiety is naturally present when AI is part of the recruitment process, the anxiety doesn't really affect the completion of job applications and therefore, organizations do not need to spend money on either hiding their use of AI or reducing the anxiety levels of potential candidates. To the contrary, the research suggests that organizations do not need to hide their use of AI in fear of alienating potential candidates, rather organizations may want to promote their use of AI in the recruitment process and focus on potential candidates that already have positive views of both the organization and AI.",,,,,"van Esch, Patrick/ABE-9472-2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0747-5632,1873-7692,,,,JAN,2019,90,,,,,,215,222,,10.1016/j.chb.2018.09.009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2018.09.009,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000453338700022,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, scholarship has yet to show how such use impacts student evaluations, which are often skewed by gender bias. Toward this aim, we conducted a quasi-experiment in which college-student participants viewed student work along with instructor feedback under four experimental conditions. In one condition, participants were told the grade and feedback were written by the instructor and, in another, that the feedback was generated by an AI tool trained by the instructor. Instructor gender was also manipulated. Participants evaluated the assessment and the instructor using measures of agency and competence. We found that perceptions of agency and competence were higher for male instructors than for female instructors who did not use an AI tool. However, when instructors used AI, marked reductions in gender differences occurred. These findings suggest that AI complicates perceptions of agency and competence enough to potentially level the playing field for female instructors. However, perceptions of instructors were universally more negative when participants were told the assessment was created with AI, regardless of instructor gender.

Moreover, Abs Cap mediates this relationship partially, highlighting its crucial role in translating improved knowledge access and analysis enabled by AI into enhanced clinical outcomes.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings suggest that health-care organizations should invest in developing AIKM alongside strengthening Abs cap to maximize the positive impact of AI on CP and ultimately improve patient care. Future research can explore specific AIKM components and Abs cap facets influencing different aspects of CP.Originality/valueThis study represents a pioneering effort to conceptualize AIKM within the health-care context and empirically establish it as a higher-order factor. The inclusion of marketing strategies underscores the potential of AIKM not only in improving clinical outcomes but also in transforming health-care marketing. The mediating role of Abs Cap emphasizes the importance of organizational structures and processes that facilitate the absorption and utilization of knowledge, thereby contributing to both clinical and marketing excellence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1367-3270,1758-7484,,,,JAN 22,2025,29,2,,,,,415,441,,10.1108/JKM-01-2024-0111,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-01-2024-0111,,DEC 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001382284400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

With the rapid adoption of AI technology in the field of marketing, it is crucial to understand how consumer adoption of the information generated by AI can be improved. This study explores a novel relationship between number presentation details associated with AI and consumers' behavioral and evaluative responses toward AI. We theorized that consumer trust would mediate the preciseness effect on consumer judgment and evaluation of the information provided by AI. The results of five studies demonstrated that the use of a precise (vs. imprecise) information format leads to higher evaluations and behavioral intentions. We also show mediational evidence indicating that the effect of number preciseness is mediated by consumer trust (Studies 2, 4, and 5). We further show that the preciseness effect is moderated by the accuracy of AI-generated information (Study 3) and the objective product quality of the recommended products (Study 4).

Three experimental studies show that compared to posts using real photographs, posts that use AI-generated images are less likely to receive favorable consumer responses. This effect arises from incongruity between gen-AI and the green schema activated by the post, which causes a) lower perceived appropriateness of a gen-AI image to the green context, leading to b) lower perceived authenticity of the post. In attempting to counter this negative impact of the use of AI, a reason for the use of gen-AI is ineffective but images generated by purpose-built AI that aligns with the green cause fully mitigates the observed issue.

Assessing a new data privacy paradox,JOURNAL OF INNOVATION & KNOWLEDGE,,,,,,,,,,,,"The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed digital marketing enhancing its effectiveness and raising new ethical and privacy concerns. This study investigates the ethical implications of AI-based digital marketing, particularly focusing on user privacy. In terms of methodology, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify relevant variables, followed by Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) using R within the framework of homogeneity analysis of variance using alternating least squares (HOMALS). The MCA analysis identified 3 multivariate groupings, and 21 individual variables extracted from 28 studies. The MCA identified a total of 4 clusters in the eigenvalues/variances analysis, and 5 clusters in the biplot analysis. The findings emphasize the need for a balanced approach that respects user privacy and ethical use of data when developing actions using AI-based digital marketing. However, no significant relationship is evident between the study of variables such as cross-device tracking or data-driven technologies and, the ethics of AI-based digital marketing, despite these being the most profitable actions in this environment. There is no evidence of developing personalized social media content or ads linked to privacy standards. However, a strong connection between behavioral analytics, smart content and metaverse is identified, highlighting the risks of this emerging technology in this research field, as it is not linked to privacy or ethics. Among the results, the strong proximity of real-time tracking, IoT, and surveillance variables underscores the critical need to ethically understand how user behavior in real-time is being monitored, as they do not offer a strong link to privacy or ethics. Additionally, this study provides 21 future research questions that address whether these practices are being ethically implemented, following standards like privacy-by-default or privacy-by-design, and complying with privacy laws in AI-based digital marketing. To ensure these practices align with ethical standards, it is essential to adopt frameworks prioritizing data dignity, which calls for treating user data as an extension of personal identity, requiring responsible and ethical handling throughout the data collection and processing lifecycle.

While considerable research exists on customers' post-purchase responses to luxury tourism products, their psychological states driven by personalized recommendations during the pre-purchase stage are not well understood. Differing from traditional marketing strategies, personalized recommendations impart implicit social labels, often exclusive to the customers. Therefore, personalized luxury cues in tourism products, driven by AI, significantly contribute to customers' positive self-perception due to their scarcity and exclusivity, further influencing their psychological states such as life satisfaction.

Evidence from expert judges shows that humans and LLMs possess complementary skills; the human-LLM hybrid outperforms its human-only or LLM-only counterpart. For quantitative research, the LLM correctly picks the answer direction and valence, with the quality of synthetic data significantly improving through few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation.

Using construal-level theory, we demonstrate that AI-generated spokespersons create a greater psychological distance from consumers, reducing empathy and ultimately decreasing advertisement effectiveness across for-profit and non-profit contexts. Furthermore, when AI spokespersons exhibit high anthropomorphic cues, the negative effect on advertisement effectiveness diminishes.Originality/valueThis research extends construal-level theory to AI-human interactions, offering valuable insights into the strategic use of AI-generated spokespersons in advertising.

However, business-to-business (B2B) marketing is one of the more notable examples. The initial assessments emphasize the significant advantages of AI in B2B marketing, including its knack for yielding unique understandings into consumer behaviors, recognizing crucial market trends, and improving operational efficiency. However, there seems to be a limited grasp of the optimal way to develop artificial intelligence competencies (AIC) for B2B marketing and how these attributes inevitably affect customer lifetime value (CLV). Equipped with AIC and B2B marketing literary fiction, this research unveils a theoretical research framework for evaluating the repercussions of AIC on B2B marketing capabilities and, subsequently, on CLV. We analyze the suggested research model using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), leveraging 367 survey replies from Pakistani companies. The outcomes show a significant relationship that describe the ability to leverage AIC to enhance CLV, and also signifies the mediating role of B2B marketing capabilities to enhance CLV by integrating AIC in internet marketing.

Our research contributes to this emerging domain by examining AI technologies in marketing via a global lens. Specifically, our lens focuses on three levels of analysis: country, company, and consumer. Our country-level analysis emphasizes the heterogeneity in economic inequality across countries due to the considerable economic resources necessary for AI adoption. Our company-level analysis focuses on glocalization because while the hardware that underlies these technologies may be global in nature, their application necessitates adaptation to local cultures. Our consumer-level analysis examines consumer ethics and privacy concerns, as AI technologies often collect, store and process a cornucopia of personal data across our globe. Through the prism of these three lenses, we focus on two important dimensions of AI technologies in marketing: (1) human-machine interaction and (2) automated analysis of text, audio, images, and video. We then explore the interaction between these two key dimensions of AI across our three-part global lens to develop a set of research questions for future marketing scholarship in this increasingly important domain.

The findings show that, in the context of AI adoption in B2B, both technology and expertise are key sources of power, and that data creates and perpetuates power negotiations and renegotiations in the network. We envisage this process as the movements on a busy dancefloor where groups of actors are engaged in what we refer to as the Power Tango.

In the marketing function of today's leading businesses, two main types of AI can be discerned. Traditional AI centres on supervised learning algorithms to support and enable the application of data rules, predictive functionality and other AI-based features. Generative AI, on the other hand, uses large language model (LLM) data sets and user prompts to generate new content. While AI-generated applications and content can boost efficiency, they also present challenges regarding transparency and authenticity, and the question of bias is central to these concerns. This article adopts a qualitative inductive approach to research this issue in the context of the marketing function of a global software supplier. Based on a systematic literature review and in-depth interviews with company marketeers, the perceived bias issues in coding, prompting and deployment of AI in digital marketing are identified. Then, based on a provisional conceptual framework derived from the extant literature, an analytical framework for revealing and mitigating bias in digital marketing is put forward, incorporating the perspectives of industry-based practitioners. The framework can be used as a checklist of marketing activities in which bias may exist in either traditional or generative AI across different stages of the customer journey. The article thus contributes to the development of theory and practice regarding the management of bias in AI-generated content and will be of interest to researchers and practitioners as an operational guide and point of departure for subsequent studies.",,,,,"Bown, Gerald Robin/KRQ-8780-2024; Wynn, Martin/ACU-8255-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2504-2289,,,,FEB,2025,9,2,,,,,,,40,10.3390/bdcc9020040,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bdcc9020040,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001431591400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

As consumer trust in social media influencers has declined, largely due to concerns about the financial motivations behind endorsements, AI tools such as ChatGPT have emerged as perceived neutral intermediaries. The research aims to understand whether AI systems can replace human influencers in shaping purchasing decisions and, if so, in which sectors. A mixed-methods approach was employed, involving a quantitative survey of 478 participants with prior experience using both AI tools and interacting with social media influencers, complemented by 15 semi-structured interviews. The results reveal that AI is favoured over human influencers in product categories where objectivity and precision are critical, such as electronics and sporting goods, while human influencers remain influential in emotionally driven sectors like fashion and beauty.

The current research investigates which types of consumers have greater AI receptivity. Contrary to expectations revealed in four surveys, cross-country data and six additional studies find that people with lower AI literacy are typically more receptive to AI. This lower literacy-greater receptivity link is not explained by differences in perceptions of AI's capability, ethicality, or feared impact on humanity. Instead, this link occurs because people with lower AI literacy are more likely to perceive AI as magical and experience feelings of awe in the face of AI's execution of tasks that seem to require uniquely human attributes. In line with this theorizing, the lower literacy-higher receptivity link is mediated by perceptions of AI as magical and is moderated among tasks not assumed to require distinctly human attributes.

To address this gap, we investigate managers' acceptance of AI usage in companies, focusing on two potential determinants. Across four experimental studies (Ntotal= 2025), we tested whether the business area (i.e., human resources vs. finances/ marketing) and AI functionality affect managers' acceptance of AI (i.e., perceived risk of negative consequences, willingness to invest). Findings indicate that managers (a) perceive more risk of and (b) are less willing to invest in AI usage in human resources than in finances and marketing.

The classifier obtained may be used to build a decision support system, to refine or update an existing system and to understand or improve a decision-making process. The described AI classification methods are compared with statistical classification methods for a marketing application. They can act as a basis for data-driven decision support systems that have two basic components: an automated knowledge module and an advice module or, in different terms, an automated knowledge acquisition/retrieval module and a knowledge processing module.

By doing so, we inform investors of ongoing digital transformations of marketing practices that will equip marketeers to provide scalable, tailored, reliable and relevant digital selfservice interactions to users, consequently improving the user/customer experience. Design/methodology/approach - Thematic analysis was used to discover factors to enable the successful implementation of digital human avatars, drawing on in-depth interviews with fourteen executives of digital human avatars developer companies worldwide and analysis of ten podcasts and webinars with artificial intelligence (AI) experts. Findings - Digital human avatars revitalise the international dynamic marketing capabilities (IDMCs) of firms by integrating advanced technologies that transform user interactions, improve engagement and facilitate knowledge acquisition, dissemination and usage across various sectors and business units globally. This integration promotes a dynamic approach to international brands, customer relationships and marketing knowledge management capabilities, offering profound value to users and firms. Research limitations/implications - Our first limitation is a lack of diversity in data sources. As digital human avatars are an emerging field, we had to limit our study to 14 experts in AI and 10 podcasts. While this method provides deep insights into the perspectives of those directly involved in the development and implementation of digital human avatars, it may not capture the views of end-users or consumers who interact with these avatars, which can be an avenue for further research. Our second limitation is the potential bias in the interpretation of our interview data and podcasts. This study's approach to data analysis, where themes are derived from the data itself, carries a risk of subjective interpretation by the researchers. Future studies are encouraged to investigate the impact of digital human avatars across different organisational contexts and ecosystems, especially focusing on how these technologies are integrated and perceived in various international markets. Practical implications - The novel framework has direct implications for innovators and marketing practitioners who aim to adopt digital human avatars in their marketing practices to enhance the effectiveness of international marketing strategies. Social implications - The adoption of digital human avatars can alleviate loneliest elderly and vulnerable people by being a companion. The human-like characteristics can impact sense of presence and attachment. Originality/value - The novelty of our study lies in exploring the characteristics of technologies and practical factors that maximise the successful adoption of digital human avatars. We advance and contribute to the emerging theory of avatar marketing, IDMCs and absorptive capacity by demonstrating how digital human avatars could be adopted as part of a firm's global digital marketing strategy. We focus specifically on six dimensions: outcomes and benefits, enhancements and capabilities, applications and domains, future implications, foundational elements and challenges and considerations. This framework has direct implications for innovators and marketing practitioners who aim to adopt digital human avatars in their marketing practices to enhance the effectiveness of international marketing strategies.",,,,,"; Kakabadse, Nada/R-7481-2018","Oliveira, Fabio/0000-0002-1433-0612; Kakabadse, Nada/0000-0002-9517-8279; Theodorakopoulos, Nicholas/0000-0002-2262-0054",,,,,,,,,,,,,0265-1335,1758-6763,,,,2024 NOV 19,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/IMR-12-2023-0339,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IMR-12-2023-0339,,NOV 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001356777800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While AI enhances scalability and factual accuracy, its ability to replicate emotional engagement and cultural authenticity remains unexplored. Using the Information Quality Framework (IQF), the study employs readability analysis, sentiment analysis, and thematic analysis to assess AI- and human-generated content. AI-generated travel narratives were sourced from large language models, while human content came from tourism blogs and vlogs. Findings reveal that AI-generated content is well-structured and highly readable but lacks emotional depth and trust-building elements. Sentiment analysis shows stronger emotional responses in human narratives, while thematic analysis highlights richer cultural insights. The study proposes a Hybrid AI-Human Collaboration Model, leveraging AI's efficiency with human creativity. These insights contribute to AI ethics, tourism storytelling, and digital marketing, offering practical recommendations for integrating AI into tourism content creation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1094-1665,1741-6507,,,,2025 APR 25,2025,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/10941665.2025.2486033,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10941665.2025.2486033,,APR 2025,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001475765300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, we seek to understand linkages between customer perceptions of AI service quality, AI customer satisfaction and engagement. Given the multiplicity of services offered by service organisations, customers' preference for AI service is modelled as a moderator of customer perceptions and attitudes towards AI. Data was collected from a sample of hotel customers in Australia who had previously used AI tools or services. Our results reveal a significant chain effect between AI service indicators, service quality perceptions, AI satisfaction and customer engagement.

The gradient boosting machine (GBM) algorithm was developed, consolidated, deployed and experimented on two inbound marketing channels.FindingsResearch examining machine learning implementation and operationalisation within the large consumer base is seemingly silent. This paper bridges this gap by developing and implementing a machine learning adaptive engine across two inbound marketing channels. The performance of the inbound channels revealed the significant importance of digital campaigns that are driven by machine learning algorithms. Machine learning techniques can be well positioned as an integral part of a large consumer base marketing operations with real-time one-to-one marketing capability.Research limitations/implicationsThe study explores the use of machine learning, a cutting-edge subset of artificial intelligence (AI), to drive consumer business revenue across different marketing channels. Further research should explore these marketing channels in greater depth by considering other branches of AI in driving consumer business revenue.Practical implicationsThis study demonstrates the value, ease and application of a machine learning deployment in a consumer business with a large customer base in driving business revenue. It also shows customers' practical response to offerings across channels and the importance of the digital channel to firms with a large customer base.Originality/valueThe paper defines how machine learning extracts can be deployed and operationalised by marketers to drive business revenue.

However, current AI marketing agents are often perceived as cold and uncaring and can be poor substitutes for human-based interactions. Addressing this issue, this article argues that artificial empathy needs to become an important design consideration in the next generation of AI marketing applications. Drawing from research in diverse disciplines, we develop a systematic framework for integrating artificial empathy into AI-enabled marketing interactions. We elaborate on the key components of artificial empathy and how each component can be implemented in AI marketing agents. We further explicate and test how artificial empathy generates value for both customers and firms by bridging the AI-human gap in affective and social customer experience.

The results of this experimental study extend previous studies on managerial decisions by demonstrating that participants' perception of the explanation quality differed between AI and humans. The explanation behind human advice was perceived as less satisfying, needing more information about the recommendation. In contrast, receiving an AI-generated advice positively changed their perception of the explanation quality. They perceived the explanation as more sufficient without the need for further clarification. These findings contribute to understand the individual perception of the explanation quality of AI-generated recommendations. Including explainability of AI in the decision process is important for building user trust. Thus, this paper is intended to stimulate further research on the use of AI for managerial decisions in marketing, particularly examining the importance of explanations in the decision process to improve AI acceptance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2190-3018,2190-3026,978-981-16-9268-0; 978-981-16-9267-3,,,,2022,279,,,,,,15,21,,10.1007/978-981-16-9268-0_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-9268-0_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000787119600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet empirical research on AI-powered B2B marketing, and particularly on the socio-technical aspects of its use, is sparse. This study uses Activity Theory (AT) as a theoretical lens to examine AI-powered B2B marketing as a collective activity system, and to illuminate the contradictions that emerge when adopting and implementing AI into traditional B2B marketing practices. AT is appropriate in the context of this study, as it shows how contradictions act as a motor for change and lead to transformational changes, rather than viewing tensions as a threat to prematurely abandon the adoption and implementation of AI in B2B marketing. Based on eighteen interviews with industry and academic experts, the study identifies contradictions with which marketing researchers and practitioners must contend.
