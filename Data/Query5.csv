If this trend continues, would it signal the beginning of an era of diminishing demand for new accounting professionals and a shift in the required skill set of new accounting employees? The aim of the workshop, which, by happenstance, occurred the same week that OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, was to bring together Accounting Information Systems researchers and representatives from leading accounting firms for a conversation on the implications of AI for the accounting profession and related research opportunities.

Design/methodology/approach The authors conduct a Delphi study to identify the new roles and tasks in future accounting. In addition, the authors use expert workshops to clarify the related tasks and skills and determine whether either humans or AI-based technologies perform the roles or collaborate in professional accounting occupations. Findings The results show that tasks and skills for existing professional occupations in the broader acounting context will be subject to major changes in the next 10 years due to (AI based) digital technologies, while core roles and tasks will continue to exist in the future, some will not be performed by humans but by AI-based technology.

Commentators have highlighted the need for increased research exploring accounting and AI and for accounting scholars to consider multi-disciplinary research in this area. This study uses a form of topic modelling to analyse literature exploring AI and related techniques in an accounting context. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has been used to enable probabilistic, machine-based interrogation of large volumes of literature. This study applies LDA to the abstracts of 930 peer-reviewed academic publications from a variety of disciplines to identify the most significant accounting and AI topics discussed in the literature during the period 1990 to 2023. Our findings suggest that prior literature reviews based on more traditional methodologies do not capture a comprehensive picture of accounting and AI research.

We argue that the recent accelerated growth of AI, especially large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, raises significant issues and challenges that the accounting academy needs to urgently address to survive in the long term. Developments in AI have, we suggest, created a 'changeinducing crisis', presenting a unique opportunity for accounting academics to address the uncritical and problematic functionalist view of the discipline and the technical reductionism of accounting. Our arguments represent a call for action to embrace AI in learning and teaching practices in a way that brings about a renewed focus on the human dimension of accounting, incorporating broader social and critical perspectives, thereby addressing longstanding calls for change in AE to move beyond the technical, managerial, and financial focus (core of the AE curriculum) that has dominated the discipline for many decades. Accounting academics have a fundamental role to play in recognising the nature of the threats and the associated challenge of AI and to seize the opportunities available in ways that bring both critique and being critical to the fore.

Efforts to develop standards for auditing artificial intelligence (AI) systems have therefore understandably gained momentum. However, current approaches are not just insufficient, but can be actively harmful. Transparency alone does not address concerns about risk. Internal auditing is insufficient, and easily becomes safety-washing. External audit is better, but requires credible standards. Industry-led approaches to building standards or to perform audits lack credibility and undermine other efforts. Regulation often is ill adapted and becomes a static barrier. Lastly, all of these limited technical, governance, and even ethical assessments fail to ensure continued stakeholder input and engagement. Instead, the paper proposes the establishment of an AI Audit Standards Board, in line with best practices in other fields, including safety-critical industries like aviation and nuclear energy, as well as more prosaic ones such as financial accounting and pharmaceuticals. This would address the evolving nature of AI technologies, help maintain public trust in AI, and promote a culture of safety and ethical responsibility within the AI industry. By ensuring audits remain relevant, robust, and responsive to the rapid advancements in AI, auditing AI will not devolve into safety washing and addresses risks and ethical concerns that will continue to arise as AI becomes increasingly important in society, and as human interaction with these systems changes over time.",,,,,"Manheim, David/AAC-1766-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0951-5666,1435-5655,,,,2025 MAY 5,2025,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s00146-025-02320-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-025-02320-y,,MAY 2025,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001481320600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The goal of this study is to establish AI-based chatbots in accounting services to improve financial management assistance and customer communication. This paper presents a novel Raven Roosting-tuned Adaptive Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (RR-ABiLSTM) model designed to classify financial queries and enhance contextual understanding in conversations to improve customer communications. The dataset encompasses both structured and unstructured data from accounting conversations, constituting a domain-specific corpus focusing on common accounting tasks. Data preprocessing included text cleaning and tokenization applied to the acquired data. Subsequently, feature extraction was performed using Word2Vec. The RR algorithm was utilized to optimize hyperparameters and feature selection, while BiLSTM ensures a deep understanding of contextual relationships in conversations, thereby enhancing accuracy and efficiency in processing financial queries. Furthermore, a dynamic training mechanism was integrated, allowing the chatbot to continually adapt to increasing consumer demands without downtime. The proposed method was implemented using Python software, and its performance was compared with traditional algorithms. The overall metrics-F1-score (87.75%), precision (89.25%), recall (86.24%), and accuracy (90%)-illustrate that the suggested model significantly improves customer engagement, reduces the workload of accountants, and enhances the overall efficiency of accounting services by providing reliable financial support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1472-7978,1875-8983,,,,2025 APR 30,2025,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/14727978251338982,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/14727978251338982,,APR 2025,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001479393400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The field of managerial accounting is a successful example of the implementation of artificial intelligence in operations and the decision-making process based on accounting information. However, ethical issues within managerial accounting and those added through the implementation of artificial intelligence need to be addressed carefully. In this paper, the main objective is to investigate these ethical issues regarding the perception of accountants on the usefulness, efficiency, and effectiveness of implementing artificial intelligence in managerial accounting. To investigate these effects, we conducted a study based on a questionnaire among 396 accountants in Romania who use various artificial intelligence solutions in their activities in managerial accounting. The results of structural equation modeling showed that the ethical issues of autonomy, responsibility, and trust significantly influence the perceived usefulness and the performance of artificial intelligence solutions. The research concludes that artificial intelligence solutions solve many ethical issues in managerial accounting. Still, through their design and application, artificial intelligence solutions can create other ethical problems specific to managerial accounting and business ethics.

This shift can play a vital role in service-oriented contexts, like accounting firms. In this study, we aim to explore how AIK can drive green intellectual capital (GIC) aspects, spurring accounting firms' performance related to environmental and sustainable practices. Drawn from the resource-based view (RBV) and knowledge-based view (KBV), sustainability culture (SUC) is integrated into the model as a moderator variable to provide an in-depth understanding of this matter. The study adopted a quantitative approach, data was collected through an online survey distributed to accounting professionals. The analysis shows interesting outcomes: AIK positively and significantly affected the internal dimensions of GIC, green human capital (GHC) and green structural capital (GSC) within accounting firms, while green rational capital (GRC) had no effect. In turn, these two internal dimensions, GHC and GSC, had a significant impact on accounting performance across various aspects, including efficiency, accuracy, compliance with environmental standards, innovation in reporting, and timeliness. Intriguingly, SUC was found to significantly moderate the association between GIC dimensions and accounting firm performance. The results of this research offer actionable insights for stakeholders and decision-makers, including accounting firms, clients, and the community at large. Accounting firms are highly recommended to adopt AI-infused platforms to foster GIC dynamics, specifically GHC and GSC. AI-infused knowledge tools have the potential to improve efficiency, accuracy, innovation in reporting, compliance with sustainability standards and timeliness, thus leading to better overall performance. Although service-oriented contexts, like accounting, have the potential to substantially benefit from GIC practices, research in such a significant discipline has been remarkably scarce.",,,,,"Bin-Nashwan, Saeed Awadh/W-6643-2018","Bin-Nashwan, Saeed Awadh/0000-0001-8919-4267",,,,,,,,,,,,,0160-791X,1879-3274,,,,SEP,2025,82,,,,,,,,102913,10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102913,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.102913,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001482283400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, most algorithms deployed in the healthcare context do not consider these aspects and do not account for bias detection. Missing these dimensions in algorithms used in medicine is a huge point of concern, as neglecting these aspects will inevitably produce far from optimal results and generate errors that may lead to misdiagnosis and potential discrimination. This paper explores how current algorithmic-based systems may reinforce gender biases and affect marginalized communities in healthcarerelated applications. To do so, we bring together notions and reflections from computer science, queer media studies, and legal insights to better understand the magnitude of failing to consider gender and sex difference in the use of algorithms for medical purposes. Our goal is to illustrate the potential impact that algorithmic bias may have on inadvertent discriminatory, safety, and privacy-related concerns for patients in increasingly automated medicine. This is necessary because by rushing the deployment of AI technologies that do not account for diversity, we risk having an even more unsafe and inadequate healthcare delivery. By promoting the account for privacy, safety, diversity, and inclusion in algorithmic developments with health-related outcomes, we ultimately aim to inform the Artificial Intelligence (AI) global governance landscape and practice on the importance of integrating gender and sex considerations in the development of algorithms to avoid exacerbating existing or new prejudices.

J,"Kureljusic, M; Karger, E",,,,"Kureljusic, Marko; Karger, Erik",,,Forecasting in financial accounting with artificial intelligence - A systematic literature review and future research agenda,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ACCOUNTING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose - Accounting information systems are mainly rule-based, and data are usually available and well-structured. However, many accounting systems are yet to catch up with current technological developments. Thus, artificial intelligence (AI) in financial accounting is often applied only in pilot projects. Using AI-based forecasts in accounting enables proactive management and detailed analysis. However, thus far, there is little knowledge about which prediction models have already been evaluated for accounting problems. Given this lack of research, our study aims to summarize existing findings on how AI is used for forecasting purposes in financial accounting. Therefore, the authors aim to provide a comprehensive overview and agenda for future researchers to gain more generalizable knowledge. Design/methodology/approach - The authors identify existing research on AI-based forecasting in financial accounting by conducting a systematic literature review. For this purpose, the authors used Scopus and Web of Science as scientific databases. The data collection resulted in a final sample size of 47 studies. These studies were analyzed regarding their forecasting purpose, sample size, period and applied machine learning algorithms. Findings - The authors identified three application areas and presented details regarding the accuracy and AI methods used. Our findings show that sociotechnical and generalizable knowledge is still missing. Therefore, the authors also develop an open research agenda that future researchers can address to enable the more frequent and efficient use of AI-based forecasts in financial accounting. Research limitations/implications - Owing to the rapid development of AI algorithms, our results can only provide an overview of the current state of research. Therefore, it is likely that new AI algorithms will be applied, which have not yet been covered in existing research. However, interested researchers can use our findings and future research agenda to develop this field further. Practical implications - Given the high relevance of AI in financial accounting, our results have several implications and potential benefits for practitioners. First, the authors provide an overview of AI algorithms used in different accounting use cases. Based on this overview, companies can evaluate the AI algorithms that are most suitable for their practical needs. Second, practitioners can use our results as a benchmark of what prediction accuracy is achievable and should strive for. Finally, our study identified several blind spots in the research, such as ensuring employee acceptance of machine learning algorithms in companies. However, companies should consider this to implement AI in financial accounting successfully. Originality/value - To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet been conducted that provided a comprehensive overview of AI-based forecasting in financial accounting. Given the high potential of AI in accounting, the authors aimed to bridge this research gap. Moreover, our cross-application view provides general insights into the superiority of specific algorithms.",,,,,,"Kureljusic, Marko/0000-0003-4382-0669",,,,,,,,,,,,,0967-5426,1758-8855,,,,JAN 18,2024,25,1,,,,,81,104,,10.1108/JAAR-06-2022-0146,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JAAR-06-2022-0146,,MAY 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000984642300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study derives implications for accounting and auditing scholars and practitioners. Design/methodology/approach This research is rooted in the hermeneutics tradition of interpretative accounting research, in which the reader and the texts engage in a form of dialogue. To substantiate this dialogue, the authors conduct a theoretically informed, narrative (semi-systematic) literature review spanning the years 2015-2020. This review's narrative is driven by the depicted contexts and the accounting/auditing practices found in selected articles are used as sample instead of the research or methods. Findings In the thematic coding of the selected papers the authors identify five major ethical challenges of AI-based decision-making in accounting: objectivity, privacy, transparency, accountability and trustworthiness. Using Rest's component model of antecedents for ethical decision-making as a stable framework for our structure, the authors critically discuss the challenges and their relevance for a future human-machine collaboration within varying agency between humans and AI. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature on accounting as a subjectivising as well as mediating practice in a socio-material context. It does so by providing a solid base of arguments that AI alone, despite its enabling and mediating role in accounting, cannot make ethical accounting decisions because it lacks the necessary preconditions in terms of Rest's model of antecedents. What is more, as AI is bound to pre-set goals and subjected to human made conditions despite its autonomous learning and adaptive practices, it lacks true agency. As a consequence, accountability needs to be shared between humans and AI. The authors suggest that related governance as well as internal and external auditing processes need to be adapted in terms of skills and awareness to ensure an ethical AI-based decision-making.",,,,,"Ittonen, Kim/JCE-5977-2023; Lehner, Othmar/F-1599-2010","Strom, Eva/0000-0002-6115-8181; Ittonen, Kim/0000-0002-2917-4077; Lehner, Othmar/0000-0002-3317-9604",,,,,,,,,,,,,0951-3574,1758-4205,,,,JUN 21,2022,35,9,,,,,109,135,,10.1108/AAAJ-09-2020-4934,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/AAAJ-09-2020-4934,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000815530900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The ongoing technological revolution is disrupting the traditional professions with fundamental changes and - in some cases - even with the threat of disappearance of jobs. The finance and accounting professions are expected to undergo a technological change in the near future. While the changes are visible at the corporate level, university education seems to lag one step behind. We conducted a study among the students and graduates of the finance and accounting line of studies at the Cracow University of Economics. Using regression analysis, we investigate the perception of the usefulness of courses providing knowledge on new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). We use a unique Polish setting, which is a leader in terms of outsourcing services. Our findings show that both students and graduates are aware of the importance of technological change.

To achieve this, the paper explores the moderating effects of artificial intelligence (AI) and accounting education quality on the relationship between green accounting and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - Using generalized method of moments estimation, this research uses a comprehensive dataset comprising 32,680 firm-year observations of listed companies from ten prominent countries - Canada, the UK, the USA, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, South Korea and Italy - over the period from 2012 to 2022. These countries, selected based on their high gross domestic product rankings as reported by the International Monetary Fund, ensure a diverse representation of economic strengths and capture a wide range of green accounting practices. Findings - The study shows that green accounting practices positively impact current firm performance. Country-level AI positively moderates this relationship, suggesting that advanced AI infrastructure enhances the benefits of green accounting through improved data accuracy and decision-making. However, country-level accountancy education quality negatively moderates the relationship, indicating that stringent implementation of green accounting standards in these regions may introduce complexities and costs that reduce firm performance. Practical implications - Integrating AI enhances data processing, predictive analytics and decision-making, improving green accounting effectiveness. High-quality accounting education ensures accurate reporting and greater transparency. These insights, when applied, can empower businesses to optimize sustainability strategies, assist policymakers in developing targeted regulations and guide educators in preparing accountants for the evolving demands of green accounting. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to explore the combined moderating effects of AI and accounting education quality on the relationship between green accounting and firm performance.

J,"La Fors, K",,,,"La Fors, Karolina",,,Toward children-centric AI: a case for a growth model in children-AI interactions,AI & SOCIETY,,,,,,,,,,,,"This article advocates for a hermeneutic model for children-AI (age group 7-11 years) interactions in which the desirable purpose of children's interaction with artificial intelligence (AI) systems is children's growth. The article perceives AI systems with machine-learning components as having a recursive element when interacting with children. They can learn from an encounter with children and incorporate data from interaction, not only from prior programming. Given the purpose of growth and this recursive element of AI, the article argues for distinguishing the interpretation of bias within the artificial intelligence (AI) ethics and responsible AI discourse. Interpreting bias as a preference and distinguishing between positive (pro-diversity) and negative (discriminative) bias is needed as this would serve children's healthy psychological and moral development. The human-centric AI discourse advocates for an alignment of capacities of humans and capabilities of machines by a focus both on the purpose of humans and on the purpose of machines for humans. The emphasis on mitigating negative biases through data protection, AI law, and certain value-sensitive design frameworks demonstrates that the purpose of the machine for humans is prioritized over the purpose of humans. These top-down frameworks often narrow down the purpose of machines to do-no-harm and they miss accounting for the bottom-up views and developmental needs of children. Therefore, applying a growth model for children-AI interactions that incorporates learning from negative AI-mediated biases and amplifying positive ones would positively benefit children's development and children-centric AI innovation. Consequently, the article explores: What challenges arise from mitigating negative biases and amplifying positive biases in children-AI interactions and how can a growth model address these? To answer this, the article recommends applying a growth model in open AI co-creational spaces with and for children. In such spaces human-machine and human-human value alignment methods can be collectively applied in such a manner that children can (1) become sensitized toward the effects of AI-mediated negative biases on themselves and others; (2) enable children to appropriate and imbue top-down values of diversity, and non-discrimination with their meanings; (3) enforce children's right to identity and non-discrimination; (4) guide children in developing an inclusive mindset; (5) inform top-down normative AI frameworks by children's bottom-up views; (6) contribute to design criteria for children-centric AI. Applying such methods under a growth model in AI co-creational spaces with children could yield an inclusive co-evolution between responsible young humans in the loop and children-centric AI systems.",,,,,,"La Fors, Karolina/0000-0003-2030-7555",,,,,,,,,,,,,0951-5666,1435-5655,,,,JUN,2024,39,3,,,,,1303,1315,,10.1007/s00146-022-01579-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-022-01579-9,,OCT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000875794400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using a questionnaire-based survey distributed among accounting professionals in Saudi Arabia, data analysis was conducted using the partial least squares (PLS) technique. We find significant direct relationships between AI awareness and usage, AI engagement and accountants, and the impact of AI and accounting procedures. This finding suggests that accountants who are knowledgeable about and utilize AI are more likely to be engaged in AI, leading to positive changes in accounting procedures. Moreover, the robust positive relationship between AI's impact on accounting procedures and accounting efficiency indicates a significant positive influence. The outcomes revealed that AI engagement and impact played significant mediating roles in these relationships. These findings suggest that, while AI awareness and usage alone can lead to improved accounting outcomes, the effect is mediated by the level of engagement with AI and its impact. We provide compelling evidence that AI positively affects the accounting profession. Accountants who are aware of and use AI are more likely to engage in and experience positive changes in their accounting procedures.

The adoption of AI-driven systems among AAFs exerted a positive impact on financial reporting accuracy, and auditing efficiency, while a negative impact on information asymmetry. Results further reveal a significant moderating effect of big data governance, demonstrating that proper management, quality, and ethical use of data within AAFs can amplify AI adoption benefits, boosting financial reporting accuracy, auditing efficiency, and mitigating information asymmetries between AAFs and stakeholders. These outcomes not only advance scholarly conversations on AI adoption in the financial and accounting landscape but also deliver actionable strategies for stakeholders to maximise AAFs' benefits from this emerging revolutionary technology.",,,,,"Jiang, Haichang/LXB-1708-2024; Bajary, Anas/GSI-4089-2022; Ma'aji, Muhammad/A-8876-2015; Bin-Nashwan, Saeed Awadh/W-6643-2018","Bin-Nashwan, Saeed Awadh/0000-0001-8919-4267",,,,,,,,,,,,,2451-9588,,,,,MAR,2025,17,,,,,,,,100572,10.1016/j.chbr.2024.100572,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chbr.2024.100572,,DEC 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001401430800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, the substantiation of these claims with rigorous ethical analysis and reflection remains largely unexamined. This contribution endeavors to scrutinize the relationship between XAI and ethical considerations. By systematically reviewing research papers mentioning ethical terms in XAI frameworks and tools, we investigate the extent and depth of ethical discussions in scholarly research. We observe a limited and often superficial engagement with ethical theories, with a tendency to acknowledge the importance of ethics, yet treating it as a monolithic and not contextualized concept. Our findings suggest a pressing need for a more nuanced and comprehensive integration of ethics in XAI research and practice. To support this, we propose to critically reconsider transparency and explainability in regards to ethical considerations during XAI systems design while accounting for ethical complexity in practice. As future research directions, we point to the promotion of interdisciplinary collaborations and education, also for underrepresented ethical perspectives.

The main argument is that accounting was left behind by this EU proposal for regulation and its three risk categories. The future of the Artificial Intelligence Act is both inclusive (specifically addressing many activities) and exclusive (takes out from the scope of regulation certain industries and applications). Despite the rather extensive sphere of (non)application of the proposal of regulation, accounting falls in a third category of unaddressed industries. Our argument is that accounting should be taken into consideration and be included in one of the categories, according to the regulatory proposal classification. By creating a regulatory framework for accounting in AI, a certain sense of certainty can be created in the markets and in the profession.

AI-powered information and Big Data (simply data henceforth) have quickly become some of the most important strategic resources in the global economy. However, their value is not (yet) formally recognized in financial statements, which leads to a growing gap between book and market values and thus limited decision usefulness of the underlying financial statements. The objective of this paper is to identify ways in which the value of data can be reported to improve decision usefulness. Design/methodology/approach Based on the authors' experience as both long-term practitioners and theoretical accounting scholars, the authors conceptualize and draw up a potential data value chain and show the transformation from raw Big Data to business-relevant AI-powered information during its process. Findings Analyzing current International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) regulations and their applicability, the authors show that current regulations are insufficient to provide useful information on the value of data. Following this, the authors propose a Framework for AI-powered Information and Big Data (FAIIBD) Reporting. This framework also provides insights on the (good) governance of data with the purpose of increasing decision usefulness and connecting to existing frameworks even further. In the conclusion, the authors raise questions concerning this framework that may be worthy of discussion in the scholarly community. Research limitations/implications Scholars and practitioners alike are invited to follow up on the conceptual framework from many perspectives. Practical implications The framework can serve as a guide towards a better understanding of how to recognize and report AI-powered information and by that (a) limit the valuation gap between book and market value and (b) enhance decision usefulness of financial reporting.

These include cloud, big data, blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, access to distributed ledgers (blockchain) and big data supported by cloud-based analytics tools and AI will automate decision making to a large extent. These technologies may significantly improve financial visibility and allow more timely intervention due to the perpetual nature of accounting. However, given the number of tasks technology has relieved of accountants, these technologies may also lead to concerns about the profession's legitimacy. The findings suggest that scholars have not given sufficient attention to these technologies and how these technologies affect the everyday work of accountants.

Based on a sample of 33,544 Chinese firm-year instances from 1998 to 2017, this research respectively established one logistic regression and four ensemble learning classifiers (AdaBoost, XGBoost, CUSBoost, and RUSBoost) by 12 financial ratios and 28 raw financial data. Additionally, we divided the sample into the train and test observations to evaluate the classifiers' out-of-sample performance. In detail, we applied two metrics, namely, Area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) and Area under the Precision-Recall curve (AUPR), to evaluate classifiers' discriminability. In the supplement test, this study put forward an algebraic fused model on the basis of the four ensemble learning classifiers and introduced the sliding window technique. The empirical results showed that the ensemble learning classifiers can detect accounting fraud for the imbalanced China A-listed firms far more effectively than the logistic regression model. Moreover, imbalanced ensemble learning classifiers (CUSBoost and RUSBoost) effectively performed better than the common ensemble learning models (AdaBoost and XGBoost) in average. The algebraic fused model in the supplement test also obtained the highest average AUC and AUPR among all the employed algorithms. Our results offer firm support for the potential role of Machine Learning (ML)-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches in reliably predicting accounting fraud with high accuracy. Similarly, for the Chinese settings, our ML-based AI offers utmost advantage in forecasting accounting fraud.

These risks are emphasized by the unpredictability of developments in AI technology (such as the increased level of autonomy of selflearning systems), which renders it even more difficult to build a comprehensive legal framework accounting for all potential legal and ethical issues arising from the use of AI. As such, enforcement authorities are facing increased difficulties in checking compliance with applicable legislation and assessing liability, due to the specific features of AI, - namely: complexity, opacity, autonomy, unpredictability, openness, data-drivenness, and vulnerability. These problems are particularly significant in areas, such as financial markets, in which consequences arising from malfunctioning of AI systems are likely to have a major impact both in terms of individuals' protection, and of overall market stability. This scenario challenges policymaking in an increasingly digital and global context, where it becomes difficult for regulators to predict and face the impact of AI systems on economy and society, to make sure that they are human-centric, ethical, explainable, sustainable and respectful of fundamental rights and values. The European Union has been dedicating increased attention to filling the gap between the existing legal framework and AI. Some of the legislative proposals in consideration call for preventive legislation and introduce obligations on different actors - such as the AI Act - while others have a compensatory scope and seek to build a liability framework - such as the proposed AI Liability Directive and revised Product Liability Directive. At the same time, cross-sectorial regulations shall coexist with sector-specific initiatives, and the rules they establish. The present paper starts by assessing the fit of the existing European liability regime(s) with the constantly evolving AI landscape, by identifying the normative foundations on which a liability regime for such technology should be built on. It then addresses the proposed additions and revisions to the legislation, focusing on how they seek to govern AI systems, with a major focus on their implications on highly-regulated complex systems such as financial markets. Finally, it considers potential additional measures that could continue to strike a balance between the interests of all parties, namely by seeking to reduce the inherent risks that accompany the use of AI and to leverage its major benefits for our society and economy.",,,,,"Montagnani, Maria/S-1042-2018",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2212-473X,2212-4748,,,,JUL,2024,53,,,,,,,,105984,10.1016/j.clsr.2024.105984,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2024.105984,,MAY 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001250344000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, investors of conventional energy assets have yet to consider the rapidly emerging AI-based assets for diversification. Owing to the rise of new categories of assets in the last two decades, which has sparked the interest of global investors to attain the most favorable outcomes, we examine volatility connectedness between AI stocks (MSFT-Microsoft, GOOG-Alphabet, AMZN-Amazon), AI tokens (AGIX-SingularityNET, OCEAN-Ocean Protocol, FET-Fetch.ai), and fossil fuel markets (WTI, BRENT, and GAS-natural gas) over the period from May 6, 2019, to July 8, 2023. We apply a novel three-dimensional framework in which we model time-domain and frequency-domain volatility spillovers at the median-, lower- and upper-quantiles in static as well as dynamic settings to achieve the objectives of this paper. We find the variation in static and dynamic connectedness between markets over timefrequencies and quantiles. Results reveal that AGIX, BRENT, FET, MSFT, and WTI are recipients, whereas AMZN, GAS, GOOG, and OCEAN are transmitters of the spillovers at the median quantile. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the short-term and long-term metrics for dynamic total connectedness might not consistently exhibit the same direction. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the short-term fluctuations predominantly influence the network's overall shock transmission, while the longer-term aspect has the potential to alter the role of a net transmitter or receiver of shocks.

Our research addresses contemporary socio-economic needs within the accounting domain, particularly the growing reliance on automation and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the accuracy of financial projections and improve operational efficiency and proposes a theoretical and empirical framework for applying neural networks to predict corporate profitability, using key accounting variables. The proposed model operates on two distinct levels. At the theoretical level, we defined the conceptual relationship between accounting constructs and profitability, proposing that shifts in financial metrics directly influence the net income. This relationship is grounded in established accounting theory and is operationalized through financial ratios and indicators, creating a clear, semantically linked framework. At the empirical level, these abstract concepts can be reified into measurable variables, where a multi-layered neural network can be deployed to uncover complex, nonlinear relationships between the input data and predicted profit. Through iterative training and testing, the model can provide plausible predictions, validated by historical financial data. We are taking time-honored accounting principles and combining them with cutting-edge technology to predict profitability in ways that have not been possible before. The hope is that by embracing this new approach, we can make financial predictions more accurate, support better strategic decision making, and, ultimately, help businesses navigate the complexities of modern financial markets. This research addresses the growing need for advanced financial forecasting tools by applying neural networks to accounting.

The effect of auditors' AI education on audit report timeliness,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS,,,,,,,,,,,,"We manually collect data on auditors with artificial intelligence (AI) educational backgrounds comprising 8201 company-year observations of A-share listed companies in China between 2014 and 2020. We then develop an auditor individual-level setting to investigate the role of AI education in audit report timeliness. Results show auditors with AI educational backgrounds are negatively and significantly associated with audit report lag, indicating auditors with AI education can shorten annual audit report times by using programming, applied technology, and logical-thinking skills, thereby enhancing audit report timeliness. In addition, this timeliness effect is more pronounced in accounting firms with more branches and among state-owned enterprises, and higher-risk clients. Furthermore, AI education and Certified Public Accountant status can complementarily strengthen this effect, particularly in companies with higher client portfolio risk.

Its particular focus lies on the management of the model risk of productive models in banks and other financial institutions. The models in view range from simple rules-based approaches to Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine learning (ML) models with a high level of sophistication. The typical applications of those models are related to predictions and decision making around the value chain of credit risk (including accounting side under IFRS9 or related national GAAP approaches), insurance risk or other financial risk types. We expect more models of higher complexity in the space of anti-money laundering, fraud detection and transaction monitoring as well as a rise of AI/ML models as alternatives to current methods in solving some of the more intricate stochastic differential equations needed for the pricing and/or valuation of derivatives. The same type of model is also successful in areas unrelated to risk management, such as sales optimization, customer lifetime value considerations, robo-advisory, and other fields of applications. The paper refers to recent related publications from central banks, financial supervisors and regulators as well as other relevant sources and working groups. It aims to give practical advice for establishing a risk-based governance and testing framework for the mentioned model types and discusses the use of recent technologies, approaches, and platforms to support the establishment of responsible, trustworthy, explainable, auditable, and manageable AI/ML in production.

Within the income accounting identity we partition capital into non-IT and IT capital and analytically derive an accounting identity (AI)-based Cobb-Douglas form that both nests the three-input Cobb-Douglas and provides additional terms based on wage rates and rates of return to non-IT and IT capital. To empirically confirm the theoretical derivation, we use a specially constructed data set from a subset of the U. S. manufacturing industry that involve elaborate calculations of rates of return-a data set that is infeasible to obtain for most productivity studies-to estimate the standard Cobb-Douglas and our AI-based form. We find that estimates from our AI-based form correspond with those of the Cobb-Douglas, and our AI-based form has significantly greater explanatory power. In addition, empirical estimation of both forms is relatively robust to the assumption of intertemporally stable input shares required to derive the AI-based form, although there may be limits. Thus, in the context of future research the Cobb-Douglas form and its application in IT productivity work have a theoretically and empirically supported basis in the accounting identity. A poor fit to data or unexpected coefficient estimates suggests problems with data quality or intertemporally unstable input shares. Our work also shows how some returns to IT that do not show up in output elasticities can be found in total factor productivity (TFP)-the novel ways inputs are combined to produce output. The critical insight for future research is that many unobservables that have been considered part of TFP can be manifested in rates of return to IT capital, non-IT capital, and labor-rates of return that are separated from TFP in our AI-based form. Finally, finding that the additional rates of return terms partially explain TFP confirms the need for future IT productivity researchers to incorporate time-varying TFP in their models.",,,,,,"Kundisch, Dennis/0000-0002-2078-7221; Nault, Barrie/0000-0001-7856-885X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1047-7047,1526-5536,,,,SEP,2014,25,3,,,,,449,467,,10.1287/isre.2014.0534,http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/isre.2014.0534,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000343098100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The extant literature observes that contemporary AI applications have augmented HR functionalities. AI-Augmented HRM HRM(AI) has assumed strategic importance for achieving HRM domain-level outcomes and organisational outcomes for a sustainable competitive advantage. Moreover, there is increasing evidence of literature reviews pertaining to the use of AI applications in different management disciplines (i.e., marketing, supply chain, accounting, hospitality, and education). There is a considerable gap in existing studies regarding a focused, systematic literature review on HRM(AI), specifically for a multilevel framework that can offer research scholars a platform to conduct potential future research. To address this gap, the authors present a systematic literature review (SLR) of 56 articles published in 35 peer-reviewed academic journals from October 1990 to December 2021. The purpose is to analyse the context (i.e., chronological distribution, geographic spread, sector-wise distribution, theories, and methods used) and the theoretical content (key themes) of HRM(AI) research and identify gaps to present a robust multilevel framework for future research. Based upon this SLR, the authors identify noticeable research gaps, mainly stemming from - unequal distribution of previous HRM(AI) research in terms of the smaller number of sector/country-specific studies, absence of sound theoretical base/frameworks, more research on routine HR functions(i.e. recruitment and selection) and significantly less empirical research. We also found minimal research evidence that links HRM(AI) and organisational-level outcomes.

Evidence from Europe,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ACCOUNTING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical evidence regarding the classification of European countries based on accounting quality metrics. The authors investigate whether the grouping of countries based on accounting quality levels differs from other classifications based on accounting practices or country-specific factors identified in previous studies. Design/methodology/approach The authors run panel data regressions for 2.078 European listed companies using value relevance and earnings smoothing metrics. The authors also apply cluster analysis to classify the countries. Findings The results suggest that the adoption of a common set of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) did not lead to a similar level of accounting quality of financial information. The authors identified three clusters of countries that are not coincident with previous classifications. Research limitations/implications The results show that the adoption of different accounting practices allowed in IFRS does not necessarily influence accounting quality. Practical implications The results suggest that the way regulators decided to incorporate IFRS into national accounting systems is one issue that may be relevant in explaining the three clusters. Originality/value The paper provides empirical evidence that supports two theoretical assertions. The first is that a classification depends entirely on the characteristics used to represent the countries being classified.

However, it also presents significant ethical challenges, including algorithmic biases, transparency, accountability, and fairness. This study aimed to investigate the sources of bias and risks posed by AI systems applied in auditing and the complex downstream interactions and effects they have. The study also explored the technical and ethical guardrails proposed and recommendations for translating principles into auditing practice. A systematic methodology was employed to acquire relevant studies across scientific databases. This involved a three-step process, including a targeted search query using Boolean operators and snowballing to yield 310 preliminary publications. A systematic review process was then conducted to identify 123 relevant articles focused on AI's implications for auditing, accounting, finance, or assurance contexts. Finally, screening and filtering on research quality distilled 83 high-quality publications from the year 2018 to 2023 spanning computer science, accounting, management science, and ethics disciplines. The analysis revealed five primary sources driving technical and human biases: data deficiencies, demographic homogeneity, spurious correlations, improper comparators, and cognitive biases. It also highlighted wider issues, such as trade-offs between efficiency and diligence, erosion of human skills and judgement, data dependence risks, and privacy violations from uncontrolled personal data exploitation. The study found promising remedies, including causal modeling to enable auditors to uncover subtle biases, representative algorithmic testing to evaluate fairness, periodic auditing of AI systems, human oversight alongside automation, and embedding ethical values like fairness and accountability into system design.

Recently, novel methods derived from Deep-Learning (DL) such as Autoencoder Neural Networks (AENNs) have been proposed to audit the large volumes of a statement's underlying accounting records. However, due to their vast number of parameters, such models exhibit the drawback of being inherently opaque. At the same time, the concealing of a model's inner workings often hinders its real-world application in financial audits, since auditors must reasonably explain and justify their audit decisions. Nowadays, various Explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been proposed to address this challenge, e.g., SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). However, in unsupervised DL as often applied in financial audits, these methods explain the model output at the level of encoded variables. As a result, the explanations of AENNs are often hard to comprehend by human auditors. To mitigate this drawback, we propose Reconstruction Error SHapley Additive exPlanations Extension (RESHAPE), which explains the model output on an aggregated attribute level.

The subjects included 111 boys and 93 girls, aged 8-11 years old. The frequency of the A allele was 0.19 in the total sample, and 0.21 and 0.17 in boys and girls, respectively. Using analysis of variance, we found the G/A substitution was significantly associated with plasma levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apo B, and apo AI in boys, accounting for 7.0, 4.2, 5.3, and 4.3% of the sample variance, respectively. Individuals with an A allele had higher mean levels of these lipid traits than individuals homozygous for the G allele. A dietary intervention study had been carried out in a subset of these children, and the effect of the G/A substitution on plasma apo AI levels remained when boys changed to a low fat low cholesterol diet. However, no significant association was observed in girls between any of the lipid traits and the G/A genotypes. We have previously reported in this sample of children that the two polymorphisms detected with restriction enzyme PvuII, with variable sites in the first intron of the apo CIII gene (Pvu II-CIII) and the apo CIII-AIV intergenic region (Pvu II-AIV), were associated with significant differences on plasma apo AI levels. We found that the association reached statistical significance in boys only in this study. Taking these three polymorphisms together, the effects on plasma apo AI levels were additive in boys, accounting for 20.0% of the sample variance. Boys having the genotype GG/V-V+ of the G/A substitution and the PvuII-AIV RFLP had mean apo AI levels 36 mg/dl lower than boys with the genotype GA+AA/V-V-. In girls, however, there was evidence of significant interaction of effects between the PvuII-AIV RFLP and the G/A substitution (P < 0.04), with the A allele being associated with higher levels of plasma apo AI only in girls having the rare allele (V+) of the PvuII-AIV RFLP. We conclude that genetic variation at the apo AI-CIII-AIV gene cluster is having a major impact on the determination of plasma apo AI levels in this sample of young boys, with additive effects due to functional changes at several places in this gene cluster detected directly (G/A) or in allelic association with the PvuII-CIII and PvuII-AIV polymorphisms. These effects are not modulated by diet but are modulated by other factors, possibly hormones, which are present in girls.",,,,,"Humphries, Stephen/C-5075-2008","Xu, Chun-Fang/0000-0002-8747-0683",,,,,,,,,,,,,0741-0395,,,,,,1993,10,2,,,,,113,122,,10.1002/gepi.1370100204,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gepi.1370100204,,,,,,,,8339925,,,,,WOS:A1993LC94500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

First, in order to identify the level of complexity in accounting standards, we calculated a new measure that conceptualizes accounting complexity based on the theoretical dimensions of multiplicity and diversity. To calculate this new measure, the content of each International Financial Reporting Standard and International Accounting Standard, in 2018, was analyzed. Second, we investigated whether the level of enforcement affects this score, using the number of enforcements published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Our results show that accounting standards with a higher number of enforcements by ESMA are also more complex, suggesting that enforcement is an important factor that explains the level of complexity of an accounting standard. This study is particularly relevant for regulators in the accounting, auditing, and enforcement fields, since it provides evidence of how enforcement contributes to increasing the level of complexity of accounting standards. This study contributes to the debate on the interdependence of enforcement and accounting regulation, showing that enforcement mechanisms can influence accounting standards.

In this study, artificial intelligence (AI)-based imaging was performed to determine sodium intake in these patients. Objective: The applicability of a diet management system was evaluated using AI -based imaging to assess the sodium content of diets prescribed for hospitalized patients. Methods: Based on the information on the already investigated nutrients and quantity of food, consumed sodium was analyzed through photographs obtained before and after a meal. We used a hybrid model that first leveraged the capabilities of the You Only Look Once, version 4 (YOLOv4) architecture for the detection of food and dish areas in images. Following this initial detection, 2 distinct approaches were adopted for further classification: a custom ResNet-101 model and a hyperspectral imaging -based technique. These methodologies focused on accurate classification and estimation of the food quantity and sodium amount, respectively. The 24 -hour urine sodium (UNa) value was measured as a reference for evaluating the sodium intake. Results: Results were analyzed using complete data from 25 participants out of the total 54 enrolled individuals. The median sodium intake calculated by the AI algorithm (AI-Na) was determined to be 2022.7 mg per day/person (adjusted by administered fluids). A significant correlation was observed between AI-Na and 24 -hour UNa, while there was a notable disparity between them. A regression analysis, considering patient characteristics (eg, gender, age, renal function, the use of diuretics, and administered fluids) yielded a formula accounting for the interaction between AI-Na and 24 -hour UNa. Consequently, it was concluded that AI-Na holds clinical significance in estimating salt intake for hospitalized patients using images without the need for 24 -hour UNa measurements. The degree of correlation between AI-Na and 24 -hour UNa was found to vary depending on the use of diuretics.

The financial information which is produced in all of the accounting processes is related with a lot of users particularly as the customers. A customer focused management approach became very important in today's enterprises. Because the quality of the products which are produced by the company is evaluated by the customers. The performance of the enterprise is measured by means of using the indicators such as service quality, error rate, rate of performing the services in time. What kind of arrangements should be performed in order to cover the customer expectations in a customer focused management system form the internal processes, namely introverted accounting dimension. The in-enterprise process dimension is focused on the internal processes which make the most important influence on the financial purposes of the organization as well as the customer satisfaction. Each enterprise has a unique transaction process with regard to creating values for the customers and obtaining fmancial profits.The customers and recognizing in-enterprise process dimension are the most important factors in terms of current and future success. It is not possible for the enterprises to meet the internal processes and long term needs of the target audience by means of using the today's technology and capabilities.

Three experiments show that subjective SES has a negative impact on consumers' willingness to accept AI evaluation. Consumers with higher subjective SES are more likely to resist AI evaluation because they perceive that AI agents are not as capable as human agents of identifying their talents. This effect is moderated by the agent type-the impact of subjective SES on resistance to the AI agent is attenuated when the AI agent is non-evaluative.

However, little is known about who (male students vs female students), at which age (under 21, 21-25 and 26-30) and at which stage of their undergraduate education (freshman, junior or senior) can attain and retain an adequate understanding of sustainability in accounting education. For this reason, the present study aims to investigate the students' interest in sustainability in accounting with respect to their demographic factors.Design/methodology/approachThe study used a quantitative research design where data were collected at a single point in time. Further, an independent sample t-test, one-way ANOVA and factorial design were performed on 132 responses conveniently collected from accounting students in the College of Business Administration (COBA) at Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University (PMU) in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia.FindingsThe study found no differences between the attitudes of male and female students toward sustainability in accounting education. Similarly, no statistical differences were found in the three age categories identified in this study. However, significant results were found throughout the different academic classifications (seniority): freshman students, junior students and senior students. Further, differences in the mean scores for freshman and junior accounting students were different between the male and female students, indicating that both male and female senior students' attitudes toward sustainability in accounting education were higher than those of male and female freshman and junior accounting students. The study concluded that students achieve an adequate understanding of sustainability in accounting education related to the relativism category of the Perry model of intellectual development.Originality/valueLiterature on attitude of students toward sustainability in education, specifically accounting education, is questionable and needs further exploration. This is due to the fact that only a small number of accounting students have been exposed to sustainable accounting education.

Despite this enthusiasm, it is important to underscore AI's potential adverse effects on consumers' financial decisions. We introduce the AIIMPACT model, a unifying theoretical framework for how AI can influence consumers' financial decisions. The model details how AI impacts the marketplace, affecting psychological processes and consumer traits core to financial decisionmaking (e.g., pain of payment, financial literacy). We use the AI-IMPACT model to illustrate one way AI can reduce financial well-being as its influence on the marketplace (e.g., facilitating biometric payment methods) decreases consumers' pain of payment, increasing spending.

J,"Baiod, W; Hussain, MM",,,,"Baiod, Wajde; Hussain, Mostaq M.",,,The impact and adoption of emerging technologies on accounting: perceptions of Canadian companies,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"PurposeThis study aims to focus on the five most relevant and discursive emerging technologies in accounting (cloud computing, big data and data analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics process automation [RPA]). It investigates the adoption and use of these technologies based on data collected from accounting professionals in a technology-developed country - Canada, through a survey.Design/methodology/approachThe study investigates the adoption and use of emerging technologies based on data collected from accounting professionals in a technology-developed country - Canada, through a survey. This study considers the said nature and characteristics of emerging technologies and proposes a model using the factors that have been found to be significant and most commonly investigated by existing prior technology-organization-environment (TOE)-related technology adoption studies. This survey applies the TOE framework and examines the influence of significant and most commonly known factors on Canadian firms' intention to adopt the said emerging technologies.FindingsStudy results indicate that Canadian accounting professionals' self-assessed knowledge (about these emerging technologies) is more theoretical than operational. Cloud computing is highly used by Canadian firms, while the use of other technologies, particularly blockchain and RPA, is reportedly low. However, firms' intention about the future adoption of these technologies seems positive. Study results reveal that only the relative advantage and top management commitment are found to be significant considerations influencing the adoption intention.Research limitations/implicationsStudy findings confirm some results presented in earlier studies but provide additional insights from a new perspective, that of accounting professionals in Canada. The first limitation relates to the respondents. Although accounting professionals provided valuable insights, their responses are personal views and do not necessarily represent the views of other professionals within the same firm or the official position of their accounting departments or firms. Therefore, the exclusion of diverse viewpoints from the same firm might have negatively impacted the results of this study. Second, this study sample is limited to Canada-based firms, which means that the study reflects only the situation in that country. Third, considering the research method and the limit on the number of questions the authors could ask, respondents were only asked to rate the impact of these five technologies on the accounting field and to clarify which technologies are used.Practical implicationsThis study's findings confirm that the organizational intention to adopt new technology is not primarily based on the characteristics of the technology. In the case of emerging technology adoption, the decision also depends upon other factors related to the internal organization. Furthermore, although this study found no support for the effect of environmental factors, it fills a gap in the literature by including the factor of vendor support, which has received little attention in prior information technology (IT)/ information system (IS) adoption research. Moreover, in contrast to most prior adoption studies, this study elaborates on accounting professionals' experience and perceptions in investigating the organizational adoption and use of emerging technologies. Thus, the findings of this study are valuable, providing insights from a new perspective, that of professional accountants. Social implicationsThe study findings may serve as a guide for researchers, practitioners, firms and other stakeholders, particularly technology providers, interested in learning about emerging technologies' adoption and use in Canada and/or in a relevant context. Contrary to most prior adoption studies, this study elaborates on accounting professionals' experience and perceptions in investigating the organizational adoption and use of emerging technologies. Thus, the findings of this study are valuable, providing insights from a new perspective, that of professional accountants.Originality/valueThe study provides insights into the said technologies' actual adoption and improves the awareness of firms and stakeholders to the effect of some constructs that influence the adoption of these emerging technologies in accounting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1834-7649,1758-9037,,,,JUL 17,2024,32,4,,,,,557,592,,10.1108/IJAIM-05-2023-0123,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJAIM-05-2023-0123,,APR 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001207582800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this chapter, we answer the following questions: (1) What methods are accounting faculty currently using in the classroom? (2) To what extent are active learning techniques being utilized relative to passive techniques? (3) What are the perceptions of accounting faculty regarding the use of active learning in the classroom? To answer these questions, we conducted an Internet-based survey of accounting educators (n = 300). We found that, on average, passive learning methods (e.g., lectures) comprise approximately 50% of class time, active learning methods cover slightly more than 35% of class time, while assessment activities (e.g., exams) use about 15% of class time. Regarding faculty perceptions of the usefulness of various learning methods, we found that the faculty recommend the use of every learning method included in the survey at higher levels than are currently being used. Our findings provide a baseline profile of the current use of both passive and active learning methods in accounting and their perceived usefulness by accounting educators.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have seen an increase in interest and use in the mission planning environment. Yet traditional approaches typically focus on optimizing the performance of the individual operator or the mission planning tool, not the joint problem solving that is needed for the human and AI team necessary in these envisioned mission planning environments. For example, while AI-based approaches can offload extensive processing by the human operator, outcomes of AI-based tools are seldom presented in ways that make it readily understand by a human or fit in with the overall process. This results in new and additional work for the operator as they must manually translate these outcomes into actionable information. There are also specific characteristics of AI-based approaches to consider, such as accounting for data limitations; many mission planning environments have data availability constraints or do not capture the right data. New methods are needed to specifically consider the benefits of AI-based approaches, ensure that AI derived insights are communicated effectively to operators, and optimally support operators in their own mission planning workflow. In this paper, we describe an overall approach for incorporating AI into the mission planning process. First, to consider how best to leverage the unique capabilities and constraints of a human operator and artificial intelligence technologies as a cooperative team throughout the mission planning process, we will frame the human operator and AI system as a single unit and take a joint cognitive system (JCS) analysis approach. This approach will identify the key information to jointly create the most effective mission plan most efficiently.

The field of radiology is particularly implicated, as clinical radiologists are expected to interpret an ever-increasing number of complex cases in record time. Machine learning software purchased by our institution is expected to help our radiologists come to a more prompt diagnosis by delivering point -of -care quantitative analysis of suspicious findings and streamlining clinical workflow. This paper explores AI's impact on neuroradiology, an area accounting for a substantial portion of recent radiology studies. We present a case series evaluating an AI software's performance in detecting neurovascular findings, highlighting five cases where AI interpretations differed from radiologists' assessments. Our study underscores common pitfalls of AI in the context of CT head angiograms, aiming to guide future AI algorithms. Methods We conducted a retrospective case series study at Stony Brook University Hospital, a large medical center in Stony Brook, New York, spanning from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, analyzing 140 randomly sampled CT angiograms using AI software. This software assessed various neurovascular parameters, and AI findings were compared with neuroradiologists' interpretations. Five cases with divergent interpretations were selected for detailed analysis. Results Five representative cases in which AI findings were discordant with radiologists' interpretations are presented with diagnoses including diffuse anoxic ischemic injury, cortical laminar necrosis, colloid cyst, right superficial temporal artery -to -middle cerebral artery (STA -MCA) bypass, and subacute bilateral subdural hematomas. Discussion The errors identified in our case series expose AI's limitations in radiology. Our case series reveals that AI's incorrect interpretations can stem from complexities in pathology, challenges in distinguishing densities, inability to identify artifacts, identifying post -surgical changes in normal anatomy, sensitivity limitations, and insufficient pattern recognition. AI's potential for improvement lies in refining its algorithms to effectively recognize and differentiate pathologies. Incorporating more diverse training datasets, multimodal data, deep -reinforcement learning, clinical context, and real-time learning capabilities are some ways to improve AI's performance in the field of radiology. Conclusion Overall, it is apparent that AI applications in radiology have much room for improvement before becoming more widely integrated into clinical workflows. While AI demonstrates remarkable potential to aid in diagnosis and streamline workflows, our case series highlights common pitfalls that underscore the need for continuous improvement. By refining algorithms, incorporating diverse datasets, embracing multimodal information, and leveraging innovative machine learning strategies, AI's diagnostic accuracy can be significantly improved.",,,,,"Tan, Kevin/KRP-9582-2024; Young, Austin/LDG-4797-2024",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2168-8184,,,,MAR 17,2024,16,3,,,,,,,e56317,10.7759/cureus.56317,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.56317,,,,,,,,38628986,,,,,WOS:001206774200025,View Full Record in Web of Science
