This study attempts to synthesise the existing literature in this research area and summarise the findings regarding barriers, drivers, and social implications of using AI in SCM. Methods: The methodology used for this meta-study is based on Kitchenham and Charters guidelines, resulting in a selection of 44 literature reviews published between 2000 and 2021. Results: As a summary of the results, the main areas of AI in SCM were algorithms, followed by the Internet of Things (IoT). The main barriers to AI adoption in SCM are change management, existing technical limitations, and the acceptance of humans for these techniques. The main drivers of AI in SCM are saving costs and increasing efficiency in combination with reducing time and resources. The main social factor is human-robot collaboration. As a result, there will be a decreased amount of labour needed in the future, impacting many existing jobs, especially in low-income areas. Conclusions: Therefore, it is essential for organisations that implement new technology to start as early as possible to inform the organisation about the changes and help them successfully implement them. It is also important to mention that constant learning and improvement of the employees are critical for adopting and successfully using new AI tools. Before investing in new technology, a solid Return on Investment calculation (ROI) and monitoring costs and value are critical to transforming the business successfully.",,,,,"Behrens, Viktoria/JTT-4213-2023","Winterberg, Simon/0000-0003-0959-0273",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2305-6290,,,,SEP,2022,6,3,,,,,,,63,10.3390/logistics6030063,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/logistics6030063,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000857076800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) is a powerful methodology for analyzing interdependencies among SSCM drivers by structuring them into a multilevel hierarchical framework. However, traditional ISM relies on subjective expert judgments, making it prone to inconsistencies and biases. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Hybrid AI-ISM methodology, integrating Genetic Algorithms (GA) to optimize the reachability matrix by minimizing transitivity violations and reciprocal inconsistencies. The research adopts a structured, expert-driven approach, engaging 25 domain specialists from executive, production, and supply chain management sectors within the steel industry. By leveraging AI-driven optimization, the proposed framework enhances accuracy, objectivity, and scalability, refining hierarchical structuring for effective SSCM decision-making. This study contributes to the SSCM literature by introducing a bias-resistant, computationally enhanced ISM framework, facilitating granular decision-making across organizational levels. Findings reveal notable differences in expert perspectives across professional roles. Executives emphasize strategic sustainability initiatives, particularly the Adoption of Renewable Energy, while production managers prioritize operational aspects, including Waste Minimization and Supply Chain Flexibility. Conversely, supply chain managers focus on stakeholder engagement and risk mitigation, highlighting Community Engagement and Supply Chain Disruption Management as critical drivers.

It aims to understand the special properties of the GSCM system under the moderating effects of product complexity and purchasing structure. Design/methodology/approach A thorough literature review led to the building of the conceptual framework. Six constructs were identified using systems theory. These constructs include green supply chain technological dimensions (particularly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based), green supply chain strategy, green supply chain process, product complexity, purchasing structure, and firm performance. The instrument was scientifically developed for gathering survey responses using complete design test methods. The conceptual model was eventually tested based on survey data collected from 250 automotive components and allied manufacturers in the emerging economy of South Africa. Findings The results indicate that GSCM technological dimensions (AI-based) positively influence GSCM strategy. Further, GSCM strategy was found to positively influence the GSCM process. The GSCM processes have significant effects on environmental performance, social performance, and financial performance. The product complexity has a significant moderation effect on the paths GSCM strategy and GSCM process. Originality/value The findings from multivariate data analysis provide a better understanding of GSCM system dynamics and are helpful to key decision-makers.

This review paper aims to examine the current research on AI-integrated technologies in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) to inform future research directions. We adopted bibliometric and text analysis, targeting 170 articles published between 2004 and 2023 from the Scopus database following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol. We confirm that AI-integrated technologies have demonstrated the capability to enable SSCM across various sectors. We generated ten future research topics using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method and proposed 20 propositions. The results show that AI-integrated technologies in supply chain processes primarily address sustainability, focusing on environmental and economic issues. However, there is still a technological gap in tackling social issues like working conditions and fair dealing.

More importantly, GSCM can contribute to sustainability performance enhancement. In this paper, we focus on the environmental collaboration, which has been seen as a key relational capability to facilitate the GSCM strategic formulation and execution. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (i) review the extant literature on the relationship between GSCM, environmental collaboration and sustainability performance and (ii) propose a plausible conceptual model to elucidate the relationship between these three variables in the context of Malaysian manufacturing companies. Accordingly, such thought depends upon more detailed empirical research by using advanced structural equation modeling approaches.

However, the majority of AI approaches explored in this context afford little to no explainability, which is a significant barrier to a broader adoption of AI in supply chains. In recent years, the need for explainability has been a strong impetus for research in hybrid AI methodologies that combine neural architectures with logic-based reasoning, which are collectively referred to as Neurosymbolic AI. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of supply chain management literature that employs approaches within the neurosymbolic AI spectrum. To that end, a systematic review is conducted, followed by bibliometric, descriptive and thematic analyses on the identified studies. Our findings indicate that researchers have primarily focused on the limited subset of neurofuzzy approaches, while some supply chain applications, such as performance evaluation and sustainability, and sectors such as pharmaceutical and construction have received less attention. To help address these gaps, we propose five pillars of neurosymbolic AI research for supply chains and provide four use cases of applying unexplored neurosymbolic AI approaches to address typical problems in supply chain management, including a discussion of prerequisites for adopting such technologies.

Therefore, the existing literature indicates that the important link between GSCM, EMS, and market competitiveness is missing as supply management is crucial to maintaining market competitiveness. To fill this research gap, the current study examines whether EMS affects the relationship between GSCM practices and market competitiveness. We also propose the moderating role of big data analytics and artificial intelligence (BDA-AI) and environmental visibility on these associations from a Covid-19 perspective. We tested a proposed model using the primary data (N = 283) from regression-based structural equation modeling (SEM). The results provide empirical support for the impact of GSCM on ESM and market competitiveness. Furthermore, the results show that BDA-AI and environmental visibility strengthen the positive relationship between GSCM-EMS and EMS and market competitiveness, respectively.

In this paper, we consider a specific supply-chain management problem from a company, which involves two levels of coordination: (i) yearly strategic planning in which a decision on establishing an association of every destination point with a supply point must be made so as to minimize the yearly transportation cost, and (ii) weekly operational planning in which, given the association between a supply and a destination point, a decision on the preference of available transport carriers must be made for multiple objectives: minimization of transport cost and maximization of service quality and satisfaction of demand at each destination point. We propose a customized multi-objective bilevel evolutionary algorithm, which is computationally tractable.

Supply chain management (SCM) can involve machine learning (ML) abilities and prediction models to ensure that the demands are satisfied at a minimum cost. Intelligent models can be developed to determine whether adequate inventory is accessible to encounter the predictable rise in demands, and if not, the system spontaneously begins to adjust the orders with suppliers to source the raw materials for resolving the predicted future high demand. The conventional ways of SCM can be replaced by the design of recent artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) techniques. By this motivation, this research presents a tree seed algorithm-based feature selection with optimum DL technique for supply chain management (TSA-ODLSCM). The proposed TSA-ODLSCM model involves the design of a feature subset selection approach using a tree search algorithm (TSA) algorithm. Besides, a new convolutional neural network with fuzzy cognitive maps (CNN-FCM) technique is designed for the classification process. Moreover, optimal parameter tuning of the CNN-FCM model was performed using the Henry gas solubility optimization (HGSO) technique. To exhibit the improved performance of the TSA-ODLSCM approach, a huge range of simulations were executed and outcomes were examined below several aspects. The experimental validation reported an enhanced 96.52% outcome of the TSA-ODLSCM approach over other methods.",,,,,"Hassan, Abdulkhaleq/HCH-6068-2022; Eltahir, Yasir/ITU-5261-2023; Maashi, Mashael/AAJ-3501-2020; Alshahrani, Haya/GWC-4849-2022","Maashi, Mashael/0000-0003-0446-5430; Hassan, Abdulkhaleq/0000-0002-2653-5826",,,,,,,,,,,,,0219-4775,1793-6780,,,,APR,2024,23,2,,,,,,,,10.1142/S0219477524400194,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219477524400194,,FEB 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001156369600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using a dataset of 150 certified supply chain professional questions, the models are evaluated on the basis of accuracy, relevance, and clarity, and t tests are employed to assess differences between the tools. ChatGPT outperforms Bard in both accuracy and relevance, with statistically significant results, whereas Bard demonstrated a slight edge in readability, scoring higher on the Flesch readability ease scale. Both models exhibited moderate to high cosine similarity for the majority of the questions, indicating closely aligned outputs. However, variations in their performance arose from differences in their underlying architectures - ChatGPT's iterative improvement process balances utility and safety, whereas Bard is designed with stricter safeguards to minimize misuse. These findings have important implications for the integration of GAI tools in educational settings, such as developing supply chain curricula and training materials requiring high accuracy and relevance. Additionally, the results suggest broader applications of the GAI in supply chain decision-making, operational efficiency improvements, and enhanced stakeholder communication. The study also highlights the importance of continuous model adaptation to ensure the ethical, safe, and effective use of AI technologies in professional settings.

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the wireless non-contact use of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data, for the purposes of automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to objects. This system was born in 1999 at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) when a consortium formed of professors, researchers and supply chain professionals created a global standard system for RFID. This paper explores the benefits and drawbacks of using this technology in supply chain management. Its ten year old history shows that, even at the beginning a lot of professionals were carried away by its implementation in supply chain, many companies found it difficult to measure the return on investment of this system as the cost of deployment is rather high. As a market survey executed by IDTechEx Research shows that the turnover of the RFID market was $7.88 billion in 2013 and no less than 5.9 billion tags were sold the same year, the RFID technology plays an important role as it is deployed in many different application areas, especially in supply chain management.

It is important how to identify these disruptions and risks to avoid them, therefore many risk mitigation strategies have been developed. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool to identify and predict the occurrence of risks, it is also important that the solutions to avoiding risks must be explainable for risk managers. Recently, making transparent and explainable AI models has been the focus of a large number of research studies and many posthoc algorithms such as counter-factual explanation (CE) algorithms have been developed. In this paper, first we propose an optimization problem to design a transportation schedule for the supply chain network (SCN), then to increase the resiliency and transparency of the designed schedule, the CE model is integrated into the model as a set of constraints. To design the CE, a logistic regression model is developed. The CE helps to plan the transportation schedule to avoid any transportation delay risk. The integrated CE and SCM model is used as a recommender system for risk managers to mitigate risk to the system.

Moreover, AI integration in SCM is not only a technical but also a social process, influenced by human sensemaking and interpretation of AI systems. This article offers a novel theoretical lens called the AI Integration (AII) framework, which considers two key dimensions: the level of AI integration across the supply chain and the role of AI in decision-making. It also incorporates human meaning-making as an overlaying factor that shapes AI integration and disruption dynamics.

We theorize that full-scale implementations lead to system-wide inventory optimization, which in turn leads to cost improvement associated with inventory balances and turns. To examine the question, we develop an analytical model of inventory optimization, then analyze the effects of the model with a numerical experiment, and finally confirm the results with an empirical examination. We find that firm-wide implementation is significant in explaining improvement in inventory metrics, relative to pre-implementation metrics for our sample. Our empirical tests indicate that implementing SCM software across only a portion of the firm does not impact inventory metrics, but that the scale of implementation does. More precisely, we find that firms implementing SCM software across the entire company significantly improve both inventory turns and inventory as a percent of revenue relative to partially-implementing firms and non-implementers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0735-3766,2158-1592,,,,,2008,29,1,,,,,201,+,,10.1002/j.2158-1592.2008.tb00075.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.2158-1592.2008.tb00075.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000273629300010,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper focuses on coordination between two players and cost-sharing in an SCM that considers a vendor and a buyer. For random demand and complex product production, a flexible production system is recommended. The study aims to minimize the total SCM cost under stochastic conditions. In the flexible production systems, the production rate is introduced as the decision variable and the unit production cost is minimum at the obtained optimal value. The setup cost of flexible systems is higher and to control this, a discrete investment function is utilized. The exact information about the probability distribution of lead time demand is not available with known mean and variance. The issue of unknown distribution of lead time demand is solved by considering a distribution-free approach to find the amount of shortages. The game-theoretic approach is employed to obtain closed-form solutions. First, the model is solved under decentralized SCM based on the Stackelberg model, and then solved under centralized SCM. Bargaining is the central theme of any business nowadays among the players of an SCM to make their profit within a centralized and decentralized setup. For this, a cost allocation model for lead time crashing cost based on the Nash bargaining model with the satisfaction level of SCM members is proposed. The cost allocation model under Nash bargaining achieves exciting results in SCM coordination.",,,,,"Sarkar, Biswajit/E-9458-2012; MALIK, ASIF IQBAL/F-9822-2018","Sarkar, Biswajit/0000-0002-6583-8416; MALIK, ASIF IQBAL/0000-0002-9607-6530",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2227-7390,,,,JUN,2020,8,6,,,,,,,911,10.3390/math8060911,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math8060911,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000553497300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach A decision aid was used to explore the suitability of blockchain in humanitarian supply chains. To achieve that, first, a list of barriers to HSCM was identified. Then, the intuitionistic fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (IF-DEMATEL) method was utilized to determine the relationships and the level of interdependencies among the criteria. Finally, the intuitionistic fuzzyanalytic network process (IF-ANP) technique was employed, as it successfully handles dependencies among the criteria. Findings The findings of this study suggest that interorganizational barriers are the most suitable ones, the impacts of which blockchain may alleviate. This study further suggests that trust turned out to be the most significant benefit criterion for the analysis. Research limitations/implications The readers should construe the findings of this study with caution since it was carried out using the data collected from the experts of a particular country. Moreover, the proposed decision aid contemplates a limited set of criteria to assess a possible role of blockchain in overcoming the barriers to HSCM. Practical implications The findings of this study can assist humanitarian supply chain managers to make more judicious assessments on whether they implement the blockchain in humanitarian supply chain operations. Specifically, this research may help decision makers to identify the certain barriers, the impact of which may be reduced by using the blockchain. The findings of this research will also help various decision makers make more rational decisions and allocate their resources more effectively.

This study considers a two-echelon SCM's coordination issues in a flexible production system at a smart factory. This study investigates a flexible production system as an alternative method to overcome the stock-out risk to produce complex products with high and stochastic demands for a buyer. However, higher production rates may increase the chances of system failure and imperfections. Thus, this model treats the rate of production as a decision variable. The carbon emissions in production activities have driven researchers to focus on clean productions in flexible systems for the future. The flexible production systems in smart factories considering emissions costs can help industries reduce these emissions by optimizing the production rates. The flexibility in the production systems adds up the considerable setup cost to the vendor and for this, the model considers the investment cost of technologies for setup cost reduction. Two models, the decentralized and the centralized, and solution algorithms are proposed to maintain the balance between optimal production rate and unit production cost and optimize the system cost. Besides, an optimal cost-sharing strategy is developed with the bargaining powers of SCM members. By optimizing the production rate and controlling the setup cost and lead time, the developed collaborative strategy optimizes environmental performance in terms of emissions control and economic performance with SCM optimization.",,,,,"Malik, Asif/ADS-9447-2022; MALIK, ASIF IQBAL/F-9822-2018","MALIK, ASIF IQBAL/0000-0002-9607-6530; Kim, Byung Soo/0000-0002-8340-1306",,,,,,,,,,,,,0254-5330,1572-9338,,,,2021 OCT 20,2021,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10479-021-04303-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10479-021-04303-w,,OCT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000709222900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: The aim of this study is to clarify the role and contribution of SNA when characterizing and understanding the challenges of contemporary supply chains. A literature review was conducted to achieve this. Results: The results reveal that SNA has been applied in a wide variety of areas (e.g., manufacturing and construction sectors), with an emerging application in the tertiary sector. Furthermore, the findings demonstrate that metrics related to the network and to nodes have been used repeatedly, highlighting the need for new supply-chain-related metrics, such as the novel concept of semi-directedness.

The focus is on improving operational efficiency, promoting human-centric collaboration, and advancing sustainability within supply chains. As industries progress, the need to incorporate AI technologies that improve decision-making and operational resilience while ensuring sustainable practices becomes increasingly critical. This systematic review aims to explore how AI is transforming SCM through these industrial transitions.Methods Utilising the PRISMA framework, a systematic review was conducted to gather and analyse relevant literature published between 2010 and 2023. A comprehensive search of databases including Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect was performed. The review involved rigorous screening for eligibility and thematic analysis using Atlas-ti software to identify key themes and patterns related to AI integration in SCM.Results The findings indicate that AI integration significantly improves SCM by improving demand forecasting, inventory management, and overall decision-making capabilities. Industry 5.0 focuses on human-AI collaboration, improving customisation and problem-solving. AI technologies also contribute to sustainability by optimising resource utilisation and reducing environmental impacts. However, challenges such as cybersecurity risks and workforce skill gaps need to be addressed to fully leverage AI's potential.Conclusion Integrating AI in SCM not only improves operational efficiency and sustainability but also promotes resilience against disruptions.

First, to review the existing critical success factors (CSF) literature in the context of supply chain management (SCM). Second, to analyze the occurrence frequency of every possible CSF in SCM literature. Third, to identify the vital few and the useful many CSF that are harmonized across the SCM field. Design/methodology/approach - A time-specific and term-sensitive literature review technique is undertaken to generate a list of possible CSF in SCM. The review yielded 55 papers, but only 26 empirical CSF papers were selected for analysis as the reliability and validity of the factors had been rigorously tested. Consequently, a Pareto analysis approach was applied to trace the CSF frequency of occurrence in SCM literature. By performing a Pareto analysis, this present study is able to identify and categorize the vital few and useful many CSF that are consistent throughout various fields of SCM. The review and results are tabulated and a Pareto diagram has been constructed to provide a summary of findings. Findings - Out of the 26 selected empirical papers, 25 potent CSF in SCM literature have been extracted. From the Pareto analysis, nine CSF represent 80.68 percentage of occurrence which is regarded as the vital few CSF in SCM. The remaining 16 CSF represent 19.32 percentage of occurrence and is regarded as the useful many CSF in SCM. The nine vital CSF are immensely important, because in order to achieve supply chain and operation success, one must recognize the few vital factors that are responsible for the larger impact onto the industry compared to the other 16 useful many CSF. Practical implications - The study offers some sense of assistance to SCM managers in highlighting the vital few CSF that matter most, regardless of their nature of SCM fields. Thus, saving their energy, time, and resources in determining the critical pieces of information. For academicians, this study provides a platform for future SCM CSF research and the results could aid researchers in developing the research instrument. Originality/value - This study is the first attempt to apply Pareto analysis for SCM CSF studies and critically analyzing a wide range of SCM CSF literature. The result could allow supply chain managers to focus on the internal factors, as it could implicate the external factors, and is vital for sustainable supply chain operation, plus, it could stimulate potential researcher opportunities in linking SCM CSF and firm performance.",,,,,"; Ab Talib, Mohamed Syazwan/U-8627-2018","Abdul Hamid, Abu Bakar/0000-0001-6872-2921; Ab Talib, Mohamed Syazwan/0000-0001-8190-9096",,,,,,,,,,,,,1450-2194,1758-888X,,,,,2015,10,2,,,,,234,263,,10.1108/EMJB-09-2014-0028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EMJB-09-2014-0028,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000397107100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

This research introduces a novel artificial intelligence (AI) approach, utilizing the Sugeno-Weber (SW) t-conorms and t -norms (SWt- CNs&t-Ns) for decision -making in a Dual Hesitant q -Rung Orthopair Fuzzy (DHq-ROF) context. The SWt-CNs&t- Ns are chosen for their adaptability in data unification, serving as prominent operations for union and intersection processes. Developing a set of fundamental operations is imperative to effectively utilize SWt-CNs&t-Ns and hybrid aggregation operators in DHq-ROF settings. Following the introduction of these processes, several aggregating operators have been provided. These operators include DHq-ROF SW weighted averaging, ordered weighted averaging, hybrid averaging, and their geometric counterparts utilizing DHq-ROF data. The SW triangular norm -based approach aggregates group preferences, facilitating a systematic decision -making process. Triangular norms ensure a realistic representation of interrelationships among decision criteria, leading to optimal healthcare supply chain management solutions. Furthermore, the SW triangular norm -based approach aggregates group preferences, enabling a systematic and comprehensive decision -making process. Choosing the best healthcare supply chain management solutions is easier when you use triangular norms because they give a more accurate picture of how the decision criteria affect each other. The effectiveness of the proposed AI framework is demonstrated through a series of experiments and case studies, showcasing its ability to enhance decision accuracy, reduce uncertainty, and improve overall supply chain performance.

The theoretical framework of this investigation was built on novel concepts like big data analytics-artificial intelligence (BDA-AI) and supply chain ambidexterity's (SCA) direct impacts on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and indirect impacts on sustainable innovation ambidexterity (SIA) and environmental performance (EP). This study selected employees of manufacturing industries as respondents for environmental performance, sustainable supply chain management, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and supply chain ambidexterity. The results from this study show that BDA-AI and SCA significantly affect SSCM. SSCM has significant associations with SIA and EP. Finally, SIA has a significant impact on EP. According to the results indicating the indirect impacts, BDA-AI has significant indirect relationships with SIA and EP by having SSCM as the mediating variable. Furthermore, SCA has significant indirect associations with SIA and EP, with SSCM as the mediating variable. Additionally, both BDA-AI and SCA have significant indirect associations with EP, while SIA and SSCM are mediating variables. Finally, SSCM has an indirect association with EP while having SIA as a mediating variable. The findings of this paper provide several theoretical contributions to the research in sustainability and big data analytics artificial intelligence field. Furthermore, based on the suggested framework, this study offers a number of practical implications for decision-makers to improve significantly in the supply chain and BDA-AI. For instance, this paper provides significant insight for logistics and supply chain managers, supporting them in implementing BDA-AI solutions to help SSCM and enhance EP.",,,,,"Chen, Shih-Chih/ABC-7705-2020; Chen, Chin-Tsu/JAC-8613-2023; Khan, Asif/GZK-8597-2022","Khan, Asif/0000-0002-5498-6077",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2196-1115,,,,SEP 8,2024,11,1,,,,,,,124,10.1186/s40537-024-00995-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40537-024-00995-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001308503800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adopting Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies facilitates sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) with the precise decision-making of supply chain activities and the realisation of circular development. However, according to the bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review of ar-ticles related to SSCM, few frameworks with I4.0 technologies are found to empower SSCM under circular economy (CE) logic. Thus, this article proposes a conceptual framework of I4.0 technologies-embedded SSCM, which takes advantage of five kinds of emerging digital technologies, including cloud services, artificial intel-ligence (AI), big data analytics (BDA), blockchain technology (BT), and internet of things (IoT). The CAB2IN framework is based on the technologies mentioned above alongside the design, manufacturing, delivering, using, and end-of-life stages of products and services to meet the requirements of reducing material usage, remanu-facturing, reusing, and recycling. This paper's contribution lies in indicating the trends of SSCM in the era of Industry 4.0 and proposing CAB2IN to creatively establish the virtual side of circular SSCM, which leverages the data generated in each stage to assist sustainable decision-making. CAB2IN illuminates several research di-rections for future studies of digitalised SSCM under the perspective of CE. The case of Company S illustrates the application of CAB2IN in the healthcare supply chain. This paper also summarises insightful directions of digi-talised SSCM under the proposed circular framework.",,,,,"刘, 羚迪/AFY-9244-2022; Liu, Yang/C-8320-2013","Liu, Yang/0000-0001-8006-3236; Liu, Lingdi/0000-0002-5502-9420",,,,,,,,,,,,,0360-8352,1879-0550,,,,APR,2023,178,,,,,,,,109113,10.1016/j.cie.2023.109113,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2023.109113,,FEB 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000948929900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, managing various operations in OaG-SC industries is a challenging task due to the involvement of various stakeholders. It includes landowners, Oil and Gas (OaG) company operators, surveyors, local and national level government bodies, financial institutions, and insurance institutions. During mining, OaG company needs to pay incentives as a royalty to the landowners. In the traditional existing schemes, the process of royalty transaction is performed between the OaG company and landowners as per the contract between them before the start of the actual mining process. These contracts can be manipulated by attackers (insiders or outsiders) for their advantages, creating an unreliable and un-trusted royalty transaction. It may increase disputes between both parties. Hence, a reliable, cost-effective, trusted, secure, and tamper-resistant scheme is required to execute royalty contract transactions in the OaG industry. Motivated from these research gaps, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based scheme, which securely executes the royalty transactions among various stakeholders in OaG industries. We evaluated the performance of the proposed scheme and the smart contracts' functionalities and compared it with the existing state-of-the-art schemes using various parameters.

This study aims to examine the impact of Industry 4.0-based digitalization on firms' supply chain performance, with a focus on integrating digital technologies into Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). A positivist approach and quantitative research method was employed, using a structured questionnaire distributed to 319 Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia's Electrical and Electronics industry, with 152 valid responses analyzed through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The study's research model suggests that Industry 4.0-based digitalization capabilities directly influences firms' overall supply chain performance, moderated by antifragility capability and enhanced through process innovation and social capital. The study shows that digital transformation improves firms' integration, communication, and collaboration capabilities using the Dynamic Capabilities View (DCV) and Relational View (RV) of an organization. These capabilities promote firms' process innovation, antifragility, and social capital, which can lead to improved supply chain performance, post COVID-19.

By considering different transportation modes, we control the lead-time (LT) variability. For the first time, we have attempted to determine the impact of the reliable and unreliable seller in a continuous-review supply-chain model under the stochastic environment. The authors discussed two reliability cases for the seller. First, we consider the seller is unreliable and in the second case, the seller is reliable. In addition, the demand during the lead time is stochastic with the known mean and variance. The proposed approach tries to find an optimal solution that performs well without a specific probability distribution. Besides, a discrete investment is made to reduce the setup cost, which will indirectly help supply-chain members to increase the total profit of the system. In the proposed model, the seller motivates the buyer by reducing lead time to take part in coordinating decision-making for the system's profit optimization. We derive the coordination conditions for both members, the seller and the buyer, under which they are convinced to take part in the cooperative decision-making plan. Therefore, lead-time crashing is the proposed incentive mechanism for collaborative supply-chain management. We use a fixed-charge step function to calculate the lead-time crashing cost for slow and fast shipping mode. We give two numerical examples to validate the proposed models and demonstrate the service-level enhancement under the collaborative supply-chain management in case of an unreliable seller.

It aligns with the conference's theme of exploring the intersection between P&OM and strategy during the Technological Revolution. Design/methodology/approach Utilizing a conceptual approach, this paper introduces the ERI Framework, a tool designed to evaluate the impact of AI-driven chatbots in three critical operational dimensions: efficiency (E), responsiveness (R) and intelligence (I). This framework is grounded in disruptive debottlenecking theory and real-world applications, offering a novel structure for analysis. Findings The conceptual analysis suggests immediate benefits of chatbots in enhancing decision-making and resource allocation, thereby alleviating operational bottlenecks. However, it sees challenges such as workforce adaptation and potential impacts on creativity and sustainability. Practical implicationsThe paper suggests that while chatbots present opportunities for optimizing operational processes, organizations must thoughtfully address the emerging challenges to maintain productivity and foster innovation. Strategic implementation and employee training are highlighted as key factors for successful integration.

Many businesses have wondered how the arrival of AI will affect planning, organization, optimization, and logistics in the context of SCM. Information symmetry is very important here, as maintaining consistency between output and the supply chain is aided by processing and drawing insights from big data. We consider continuous (production) and discontinuous (supply chain) data to satisfy delivery needs to solve the shortage problem. Despite a surplus of output, this article addresses the voluptuous deficiency problem in supply chain administration. This research serves as an overview of AI for SCM practitioners. The report then moves into an in-depth analysis of the most recent studies on and applications of AI in the supply chain industry. This work introduces a novel approach, Incessant Data Processing (IDP), for handling harmonized data on both ends, which should reduce the risk of incorrect results. This processing technique detects shifts in the data stream and uses them to predict future suppressions of demand. Federated learning gathers and analyzes information at several points in the supply chain and is used to spot the shifts.

Despite its revolutionizing impact on supply chain quality management, there is a notable gap in research on the implications of a manufacturer's adoption of AI inspection. This article addresses this gap by presenting a two-stage model that explores the consequences of AI inspection adoption for a downstream manufacturer and an upstream supplier. Our results show that higher AI-based inspection accuracy may not always benefit the manufacturer. This is because when the supplier's traditional inspection accuracy falls within an immediate range, the manufacturer's incentive to improve AI inspection accuracy diminishes, and the positive effect of AI inspection on retail returns cannot fully offset the technology expense. Moreover, our study explores the dynamics of technology-sharing strategies between the manufacturer and supplier. Despite potential revenue gains, the manufacturer may hesitate to share technology due to the risk of increased defective products with lower AI inspection accuracy, leading to a paradox where profitability coexists with losses. Surprisingly, the successful collaborative technology-sharing strategy may paradoxically lead to reduced technology investment. This occurs because technology-sharing enables significant marginal cost savings in retail returns, rendering the manufacturer to achieve a comparable inspection level with lower investment. Overall, this research highlights that adopting AI inspection does not guarantee benefits for the supply chain members and can sometimes be detrimental. Our study offers strategic guidance for decision-makers in supply chain quality management.",,,,,"Pei, Jun/AAC-8904-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0011-7315,1540-5915,,,,2025 MAR 7,2025,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/deci.70003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/deci.70003,,MAR 2025,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001439791700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The introduction of AI managers poses new challenges to supply chain management, and how to manage AI managers warrants further exploration. We investigate the optimal AI manager fine-tuning strategies in a supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and two competing retailers, each operated by an AI manager in the face of an uncertain market shock. We establish the manufacturer-retailer AI manager fine-tuning game, where the manufacturer and two retailers endogenously decide whether to fine-tune their AI managers' logic. The market may suffer an uncertain shock, and once the shock occurs, the AI managers' logic settings and price decisions can be quickly adjusted. We find that the manufacturer would never fine-tune the AI manager, while the retailers may fine-tune their AI managers to programmed optimism. Notably, AI manager's fine-tunability only benefits the retailers and harms the manufacturer, entire supply chain, consumers, and social welfare. To make AI manager's fine-tunability beneficial to all participants, that is, to reach a win-win-win situation, we design two incentive mechanisms, retailer pessimism incentive mechanism and mutual pessimism incentive mechanism (MPIM), where MPIM can lead to the win-win-win situation. Further, we endogenize the compensation, endogenous retailer pessimism compensation and endogenous mutual pessimism compensation, both achieving the win-win-win outcome.

When the service efficiency attenuation effect of the manual customer towards demand is stronger, AI service would bring about more demand. Additionally, when the service efficiency attenuation effect is stronger, or it is weaker but the AI service efficiency is higher, the EPSC could utilize AI service to obtain more profit under reselling mode. Under agency mode, AI service can benefit the EPSC more when the service effect attenuation coefficient is relatively larger.

It deals with the process of product return from the customer to the manufacturer. The product maybe returned due to reasons like failure, product lifetime etc. It is different from traditional logistics where processes are carried out from manufacturer to final user stage only. It can be optimized and made predictive in nature to forecast the reverse flow of commodities. Conventionally, the commodities are sent back to the manufacturer upon encounter of failure. The products, under warranty period, are immediately replaced by the manufacturer. However, the quality of the service provided is deteriorating. With the advent of information age, it is possible to be prepared for tomorrow, today.

It not only provides real-time data processing capabilities but also accelerates the decision -making process, injecting more innovative elements into SCM. In this context, SCM platforms require new technological developments and effective evaluations, as they collectively drive the efficient coordination of complex business processes. SCM platforms enable the seamless coordination of various supply chain elements, facilitating streamlined operations and enhanced decision -making processes. The evaluation of these platforms not only serves to validate their performance and effectiveness, but also contributes to continual improvements in design and application, and addressing the evolving demands within the realms of global commerce and dynamic market conditions. The ongoing assessment and enhancement of SCM platforms play a crucial role in optimizing resource allocation, improving production efficiency, and fostering adaptability to changing market dynamics. However, the acquisition of assessment data often introduces imprecise data. Additionally, the large-scale nature and bounded rationality of decision -makers (DMs) significantly impact the evaluation of SCM platforms. This article aims to explore a collaborative large-scale information fusion approach and provide a robust fuzzy framework for evaluating SCM platforms. This approach employs a combination of spherical fuzzy sets (SFSs), large-scale group decision -making (LSGDM), behavioral theories and three-way decisions (TWD) to thoroughly explore collaborative large-scale information fusion and its practical application in assessing SCM platforms. It introduces an innovative spherical fuzzy (SF) LSGDM technique and integrates TWD with the inclusion of prospect theory (PT) and regret theory (RT) to mitigate potential decision risks.

Supply chain planners need to become familiar with these systems and trust them, considering real-world complexities and challenges the systems are exposed to. However, planners have the opportunity to intervene based on their experience or information that the systems may not capture. In this context, we study planners' adjustments to AI-generated demand forecasts. We collect a large amount of data from a leading AI provider and a large European retailer. Our dataset contains 30 million forecasts at the SKU-store-day level for 2019, plus variables related to products, weather, and holidays. In our two-phase analysis, we aim to understand the adjustments made by planners and the quality of these adjustments. Within each phase, we first identify the drivers of adjustments and their quality using random forest, a well-known ML algorithm. Next, we investigate the collective effects of the different drivers on the occurrence and the quality of the adjustments using a decision tree approach. We find that product characteristics such as price, freshness, and discounts are important factors when making adjustments. Large positive adjustments occur more frequently but are often inaccurate, while large negative adjustments are generally more accurate but fewer in number. Thus, planners do not contribute to accuracy on average. Our findings provide insights for the better use of human knowledge in judgmental forecasting. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

These stakeholders offer new ways to engage customers in the co-creation of services but still face significant customer skepticism. To address this challenge, we frame interactions between customers and embodied conversational agents through the lens of stakeholder engagement and apply the concept of proxy agency from social cognitive theory. This framework allows us to identify two primary stakeholder roles for embodied conversational agents: partner and servant. We conceptualize how these roles inform optimal design for embodied conversational agents and shape a two-stage value-by-proxy process, comprising proxy efficacy and outcome expectancy. Additionally, we uncover tensions within this process due to over-reliance on AI, as well as significant outcomes that extend beyond the immediate interaction. Our study, using a custom-developed embodied conversational agent with a sample of 596 U.S.-based respondents, reveals that positioning an embodied conversational agent in a partner role, combined with a human (vs. robot) appearance and emotional (vs. functional) conversation style, has the strongest positive impact on perceived value-by-proxy, usage and advice implementation intentions, and willingness to pay. We also observe an inverted U-shaped moderation by reliance in the relationship between proxy efficacy and outcome expectancy, signaling the potential risks of over-reliance on AI. Furthermore, we provide qualitative insights into why some customers avoid engaging with embodied conversational agents.

The platform has two operational modes, namely the marketplace and reselling modes. Platform power refers to the platform's ability to increase the market size, while network effects concern the platform's effect on the offline channel. Consumers may return dissatisfied products brought from the platform within a return window. Without artificial intelligence (AI), the optimal production quantities in both the marketplace and reselling modes increase (decrease) with the platform power under low (high) network effects. The optimal profit of the manufacturer in the marketplace mode increases with the platform power and the direction may be positive in the re-selling mode. With AI, the optimal profits of the manufacturer in the two modes always increase with the platform power. Comparing the cases with and without AI, we find that using AI in the marketplace mode increases (decreases) the manufacturer's profit under low (high) network effects. And using AI in the reselling mode increases (decreases) the platform's profit under low (high) network effects.

But, according to a recent study, digital strategies for procurement are often missing or not satisfactory. Literature offers conflicting guidance on possible adoption areas for AI in core procurement processes. Given the need for better digital strategies for procurement and the need to further develop the understanding of adoption potential, the purpose of this paper is to explore actual adoption levels, experienced benefits, readiness levels and barriers to implementation in industry. This informs nuanced, not hyped, managerial consideration and identifies further research opportunities.Design/methodology/approachLeveraging items used in literature to study adoption of other technologies, the authors conduct the first empirical exploration of actual adoption levels of AI in procurement. The authors do so by collecting survey responses in three manager workshops, and the authors use the workshops to seek manager input in the interpretation of findings and the identification of implications for managers and researchers.FindingsThere appears to be less consideration given to AI in procurement than interest in the topic might imply. Adoption levels are generally low, implying that there is a lot of room for the development of consideration, use cases and possible pilots by managers and researchers. The authors find procurement benefits of AI adoption to be broader than costs and productivity alone, including visibility and innovation. But, readiness appears to be at relatively low levels with factors commonly considered in literature, such as executive support and willingness to invest, less relevant than less widely considered elements such as human sense making and supplier readiness.Originality/valueThis first empirical exploration moves past conceptualization and the study of potential adoption into the study of actual adoption levels in different procurement core processes. The authors expand the consideration of readiness by including additional items of human sense making as called for in literature. The authors also include and develop supplier readiness consideration, which is often missing from research. With the help of participating managers, the authors are able to develop a more comprehensive framework for the consideration of AI adoption.

The system includes a user interface that explains the alerts and helps to identify failure fixes. We conducted this research in cooperation with Michelin. Through experiments carried out over the course of four phases, we confirmed that machine learning can help predict service-level failures. In our last experiment, planners were able to use these predictions to make adjustments on tires for which failures were predicted, resulting in an improvement in the service level of 10 percentage points.

Design/methodology/approach Using a systematic literature review methodology, this study analyzes the publications available on Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar that linked both AI and supply chain from one side and ML and supply chain from another side. A total of 388 research studies have been identified through the before said three database searches which are further screened, sorted and finalized with 50 studies. The research thoroughly reviews and analyzes the final lists of 50 studies that were found relevant and significant to the theme of AI and ML in supply chain management (SCM). Findings AI and ML applications are still at the infant stage and the opportunity for them to elevate supply chain performance is very promising. Some researchers developed AI and ML-related models which were tested and proved to be effective in optimizing SC, and therefore, the application of AI and ML in supply chain networks creates competitive advantages for firms. Other researchers claim that AI and ML are both currently adding value while many other researchers believe that they are still not fully exploited and their tools and techniques can leverage the supply chain's total value. The research found that adoption of AI and ML have the ability to reduce the bullwhip effect, and therefore, further supports the performance of supply chain efficiency and responsiveness. Research limitations/implications This research was limited in terms of scope as it covered AI and ML applications in the supply chain while there are other dimensions that could be investigated such as big data and robotics but it was found too lengthy to include these additional dimensions, and therefore, left for future research studies that other researchers could explore and pursue. Practical implications This study opens the door wide for other researchers to explore how AI and ML can be adopted in SCM and what are the models that are already tested and proven to be viable. In addition, the paper also identified a group of research studies that confirmed the unexploited avenues of AI and ML which could be of high interest to other researchers to explore. Originality/value Although few earlier research studies touch based on the AI applications within manufacturing and transportation, this study is different and makes a unique contribution by offering a holistic view on the AI and ML implications within SC as a whole.

Traditional predictive models often fail to adapt to dynamic demand patterns, resulting in excessive costs and stockouts. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a novel fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making framework to select the optimal advanced predictive analytics for demand forecasting. Using t-spherical hesitant fuzzy sets, three decision experts evaluate alternatives against essential conflicting criteria, including accuracy, cost, adaptability, efficiency, complexity, and scalability. The logarithmic methodology of additive weights determines the relative significance of these criteria, capturing both quantitative and qualitative dimensions. The alternatives are ranked using an interactive multi-criteria decision-making approach, with AI analytics emerging as the most efficient method, followed by big data analytics in second place. The results demonstrate AI analytics' ability to balance high accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency with manageable complexity and scalability, ensuring a cost-effective inventory strategy.
