J,"Kaul, N",,,,"Kaul, Nitasha",,,"3Es for AI: Economics, Explanation, Epistemology",FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"This article locates its roots/routes in multiple disciplinary formations and it seeks to advance critical thinking about an aspect of our contemporary socio-technical challenges by bracketing three knowledge formations-artificial intelligence (AI), economics, and epistemology-that have not often been considered together. In doing so, it responds to the growing calls for the necessity of further transdisciplinary engagements that have emanated from work in AI and also from other disciplines. The structure of the argument here is as follows. First, I begin by demonstrating how and why explanation is a problem in AI (XAI problem) and what directions are being taken by recent research that draws upon social sciences to address this, noting how there is a conspicuous lack of reference in this literature to economics. Second, I identify and analyze a problem of explanation that has long plagued economics too as a discipline. I show how only a few economists have ever attempted to grapple with this problem and provide their perspectives. Third, I provide an original genealogy of explanation in economics, demonstrating the changing nature of what was meant by an explanation. These systematic changes in consensual understanding of what occurs when something is said to have been explained, have reflected the methodological compromises that were rendered necessary to serve different epistemological tensions over time. Lastly, I identify the various relevant historical and conceptual overlaps between economics and AI. I conclude by suggesting that we must pay greater attention to the epistemologies underpinning socio-technical knowledges about the human. The problem of explanation in AI, like the problem of explanation in economics, is perhaps not only, or really, a problem of satisfactory explanation provision alone, but interwoven with questions of competing epistemological and ethical choices and related to the ways in which we choose sociotechnical arrangements and offer consent to be governed by them.",,,,,,"Kaul, Nitasha/0000-0002-2245-0171",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2624-8212,,,,MAR 29,2022,5,,,,,,,,833238,10.3389/frai.2022.833238,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frai.2022.833238,,,,,,,,35425891,,,,,WOS:000915937200001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Maskara, PK",,,,"Maskara, Pankaj Kumar",,,Developing safer AI-concepts from economics to the rescue,AI & SOCIETY,,,,,,,,,,,,"With the rapid advancement of AI, there exists a possibility of rogue human actor(s) taking control of a potent AI system or an AI system redefining its objective function such that it presents an existential threat to mankind or severely curtails its freedom. Therefore, some suggest an outright ban on AI development while others profess international agreement on constraining specific types of AI. These approaches are untenable because countries will continue developing AI for national defense, regardless. Some suggest having an all-powerful benevolent one-AI that will act as an AI nanny. However, such an approach relies on the everlasting benevolence of one-AI, an untenable proposition. Furthermore, such an AI is itself subject to capture by a rogue actor. We present an alternative approach that uses existing mechanisms and time-tested economic concepts of competition and marginal analysis to limit centralization and integration of AI, rather than AI itself. Instead of depending on international consensus it relies on countries working in their best interests. We recommend that through regulation and subsidies countries promote independent development of competing AI technologies, especially those with decentralized architecture. The Sherman Antitrust Act can be used to limit the domain of an AI system, training module, or any of its components. This will increase the segmentation of potent AI systems and force technological incompatibility across systems. Finally, cross-border communication between AI-enabled systems should be restricted, something countries like China and the US are already inclined to do to serve their national interests. Our approach can ensure the availability of numerous sufficiently powerful AI systems largely disconnected from each other that can be called upon to identify and neutralize rogue systems when needed. This setup can provide sufficient deterrence to any rational human or AI system from attempting to exert undue control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0951-5666,1435-5655,,,,FEB,2025,40,2,,,,,971,983,,10.1007/s00146-023-01778-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-023-01778-y,,OCT 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001076383400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

AI systems are characterised by their complexity, opacity and autonomy in operation. Now and in the foreseeable future, AI systems will be operating in a manner that is not fully autonomous. This signifies that providing appropriate incentives to the human parties involved is still of great importance in reducing AI-related harm. Therefore, liability rules should be adapted in such a way to provide the relevant parties with incentives to efficiently reduce the social costs of potential accidents. Relying on a law and economics approach, we address the theoretical question of what kind of liability rules should be applied to different parties along the value chain related to AI.

They can provide content information and analysis across most academic disciplines, but significant differences exist in terms of response accuracy for conclusions and explanations, as well as word counts. This study explores four distinct AI chatbots, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Bard, and LLaMA 2, for accuracy of conclusions and quality of explanations in the context of university-level economics. Leveraging Bloom's taxonomy of cognitive learning complexity as a guiding framework, the study confronts the four AI chatbots with a standard test for university-level understanding of economics, as well as more advanced economics problems. The null hypothesis that all AI chatbots perform equally well on prompts that explore understanding of economics is rejected. The results are that significant differences are observed across the four AI chatbots, and these differences are exacerbated as the complexity of the economics-related prompts increased. These findings are relevant to both students and educators; students can choose the most appropriate chatbots to better understand economics concepts and thought processes, while educators can design their instruction and assessment while recognizing the support and resources students have access to through AI chatbot platforms.",,,,,"Santandreu Calonge, David/AHE-1864-2022; Smail, Linda/AAF-9136-2019","Smail, Linda/0000-0001-9388-1334",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,MAY 8,2024,19,5,,,,,,,e0297804,10.1371/journal.pone.0297804,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0297804,,,,,,,,38718042,,,,,WOS:001245054500080,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Li, Q; Philipsen, N; Cauffman, C",,,,"Li, Qian; Philipsen, Niels; Cauffman, Caroline",,,AI-enabled price discrimination as an abuse of dominance: a law and economics analysis,CHINA-EU LAW JOURNAL,,,,,,,,,,,,"In digital markets, concentrated Big Data and analytical algorithms enable undertakings to predict each consumer's willingness to pay with increasing accuracy and offer consumers personalized recommendations and tailored prices accordingly. In this context, concerns have arisen about whether and when AI-enabled price discrimination amounts to an abuse of dominance under competition law and would require a legal response. To address these concerns, this paper will analyze AI-enabled price discrimination from a comparative law and economics perspective. In economics, price discrimination is not always undesirable as it can increase static efficiency, and, on some occasions, it can promote dynamic efficiency and boost consumer welfare. Nevertheless, it may also lead to exclusionary and exploitative effects, especially once Tech Giants abuse their dominant positions in relevant markets. Since the protection of free competition and consumer welfare are objectives of competition law in China and the EU, competition law seems a proper instrument to step into digital markets to address these concerns. Indeed, the EU and China have established mixed regimes of competition law and other rules to tackle unfair and/or anti-competitive AI-enabled price discrimination. As such, AI-enabled price discrimination does not always require a competition law response and it requires competition authorities to make a trade-off between different considerations.",,,,,"Cauffman, Caroline/K-7726-2019; Li, Qian/LFS-9189-2024","Cauffman, Caroline/0000-0002-0159-9823; Li, Qian/0000-0001-9293-7017; Philipsen, Niels/0000-0002-2101-6840",,,,,,,,,,,,,1868-5153,1868-5161,,,,OCT,2023,9,1-4,,,SI,,51,72,,10.1007/s12689-023-00099-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12689-023-00099-z,,APR 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000977817800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is already well-known for its superiority in various healthcare applications, including the segmentation of lesions in images, speech recognition, smartphone personal assistants, navigation, ride-sharing apps, and many more. Our study is based on two hypotheses: (i) AI offers more economic solutions compared to conventional methods; (ii) AI treatment offers stronger economics compared to AI diagnosis. This novel study aims to evaluate AI technology in the context of healthcare costs, namely in the areas of diagnosis and treatment, and then compare it to the traditional or non-AI-based approaches. Methodology: PRISMA was used to select the best 200 studies for AI in healthcare with a primary focus on cost reduction, especially towards diagnosis and treatment. We defined the diagnosis and treatment architectures, investigated their characteristics, and categorized the roles that AI plays in the diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms. We experimented with various combinations of different assumptions by integrating AI and then comparing it against conventional costs. Lastly, we dwell on three powerful future concepts of AI, namely, pruning, bias, explainability, and regulatory approvals of AI systems.

J,"Horton, A",,,,"Horton, Andrew",,,Causal Economic Machine Learning (CEML): Human AI,AI,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper proposes causal economic machine learning (CEML) as a research agenda that utilizes causal machine learning (CML), built on causal economics (CE) decision theory. Causal economics is better suited for use in machine learning optimization than expected utility theory (EUT) and behavioral economics (BE) based on its central feature of causal coupling (CC), which models decisions as requiring upfront costs, some certain and some uncertain, in anticipation of future uncertain benefits that are linked by causation. This multi-period causal process, incorporating certainty and uncertainty, replaces the single-period lottery outcomes augmented with intertemporal discounting used in EUT and BE, providing a more realistic framework for AI machine learning modeling and real-world application. It is mathematically demonstrated that EUT and BE are constrained versions of CE. With the growing interest in natural experiments in statistics and causal machine learning (CML) across many fields, such as healthcare, economics, and business, there is a large potential opportunity to run AI models on CE foundations and compare results to models based on traditional decision-making models that focus only on rationality, bounded to various degrees. To be most effective, machine learning must mirror human reasoning as closely as possible, an alignment established through CEML, which represents an evolution to truly human AI. This paper maps out how the non-linear optimization required for the CEML structural response functions can be accomplished through Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) and applied to data sets through the S-Learner CML meta-algorithm. Upon this foundation, the next phase of research is to apply CEML to appropriate data sets in various areas of practice where causality and accurate modeling of human behavior are vital, such as precision healthcare, economic policy, and marketing.",,,,,"Horton, Andrew/MGW-4967-2025","Horton, Andrew/0000-0001-6067-8778",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2673-2688,,,,DEC,2024,5,4,,,,,1893,1917,,10.3390/ai5040094,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ai5040094,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001384135100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The survey of academics' perceptions encompasses considerations of academic integrity, transferrable skills, and ethical GAI use. The responses unveiled a range of significant findings regarding the present condition of essay-based assessment in Economics education. The most prominent of which is that, while GAI development has introduced a new conflict between integrity concerns and essay-writing, Economics academics confirm that the latter continues to be important to their graduates. However, there is an emphasis on reshaping the format of conventional essays and refining traditional marking criteria. Elevating assessment questions along Bloom's taxonomy is deemed vital for critical thinking and producing futureready graduates. Respondents also recognise the need to impart ethical awareness among students when using GAI while exploring innovative pedagogies to develop and assess the new GAI skill set. Thus, our study challenges the dichotomy of pulling the plug on conventional essays and, instead, prompts a critical re-evaluation-resuscitation through reimagination. Finally, most express interest in learning more about GAI and its educational applications, either through selfexperimentation or structured events and GAI training.

J,"Barbierato, E; Zamponi, ME",,,,"Barbierato, Enrico; Zamponi, Maria Enrica",,,Shifting Perspectives on AI Evaluation: The Increasing Role of Ethics in Cooperation,AI,,,,,,,,,,,,"Evaluating AI is a challenging task, as it requires an operative definition of intelligence and the metrics to quantify it, including amongst other factors economic drivers, depending on specific domains. From the viewpoint of AI basic research, the ability to play a game against a human has historically been adopted as a criterion of evaluation, as competition can be characterized by an algorithmic approach. Starting from the end of the 1990s, the deployment of sophisticated hardware identified a significant improvement in the ability of a machine to play and win popular games. In spite of the spectacular victory of IBM's Deep Blue over Garry Kasparov, many objections still remain. This is due to the fact that it is not clear how this result can be applied to solve real-world problems or simulate human abilities, e.g., common sense, and also exhibit a form of generalized AI. An evaluation based uniquely on the capacity of playing games, even when enriched by the capability of learning complex rules without any human supervision, is bound to be unsatisfactory. As the internet has dramatically changed the cultural habits and social interaction of users, who continuously exchange information with intelligent agents, it is quite natural to consider cooperation as the next step in AI software evaluation. Although this concept has already been explored in the scientific literature in the fields of economics and mathematics, its consideration in AI is relatively recent and generally covers the study of cooperation between agents. This paper focuses on more complex problems involving heterogeneity (specifically, the cooperation between humans and software agents, or even robots), which are investigated by taking into account ethical issues occurring during attempts to achieve a common goal shared by both parties, with a possible result of either conflict or stalemate. The contribution of this research consists in identifying those factors (trust, autonomy, and cooperative learning) on which to base ethical guidelines in agent software programming, making cooperation a more suitable benchmark for AI applications.",,,,,"Barbierato, Enrico/AAC-6349-2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2673-2688,,,,APR 19,2022,3,2,,,,,331,352,,10.3390/ai3020021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ai3020021,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001021506600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Second, will AI technology have an impact on the economy different from that of previous new technologies? Third, in which aspects will AI have an impact, and what is the empirical evidence for these effects of AI? On the first question, our review reveals that the incorporation of AI into economic models raises fundamental questions on economics and economic models. On the second question, while most empirical studies cannot deny the existence of the Solow Paradox for AI technology, some studies find that AI would have a different and broader impact than previous technologies. On the third question, studies on the labor market seem to suggest a stylized fact regarding the impact of AI on employment on different levels, and income inequality across skill levels and between developing and developed countries.

Current research in medical AI focuses on developing, validating, and implementing point-level AI applications in an ad hoc manner. To harness the full power of AI to improve the patient experience and outcomes at a societal scale, however, requires a gestalt shift-with a systematic understanding of AI in the context of healthcare-and so results in its widespread adoption. This translates to four pillars of incorporating AI into healthcare workflow, including physician buy-in, patient acceptance, provider investment, and payer support (the 4Ps). To achieve these 4Ps, it is imperative to design AI-augmented healthcare delivery systems in view of (1) how physicians integrate AI into their clinical practice and (2) how patients perceive the role of AI in healthcare delivery. This will in turn boost provider investment and payer support. In this paper, we draw from the literature to discuss a series of research questions, including barriers to physician buy-in and patient acceptance, transparency and disclosure, service design, and strategies for increasing AI uptake.

Whether implicitly followed or explicitly endorsed, these commitments constitute what we term a preferentist approach to AI alignment. In this paper, we characterize and challenge the preferentist approach, describing conceptual and technical alternatives that are ripe for further research. We first survey the limits of rational choice theory as a descriptive model, explaining how preferences fail to capture the thick semantic content of human values, and how utility representations neglect the possible incommensurability of those values. We then critique the normativity of expected utility theory (EUT) for humans and AI, drawing upon arguments showing how rational agents need not comply with EUT, while highlighting how EUT is silent on which preferences are normatively acceptable. Finally, we argue that these limitations motivate a reframing of the targets of AI alignment: Instead of alignment with the preferences of a human user, developer, or humanity-writ-large, AI systems should be aligned with normative standards appropriate to their social roles, such as the role of a general-purpose assistant. Furthermore, these standards should be negotiated and agreed upon by all relevant stakeholders. On this alternative conception of alignment, a multiplicity of AI systems will be able to serve diverse ends, aligned with normative standards that promote mutual benefit and limit harm despite our plural and divergent values.",,,,,"Carroll, Micah/ABC-6599-2020","Franklin, Matija/0000-0003-1846-8907",,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-8116,1573-0883,,,,2024 NOV 9,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11098-024-02249-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11098-024-02249-w,,NOV 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001350455800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We take this opportunity to squarely address the subject about how to insert the core theories into evolutionary economics. We argue that the alternative candidates to be replaced with the main stream core theories are in the following ordering: (1) the theory of production to invalidate myopic optimization, (2) the theory of preference to invalidate myopic optimization, (3) the SMD Theorem to invalidate invisible hand, and (4) the market mechanism to invalidate the efficiency market hypothesis.

The problem that AI-ESTATE solves can be seen as a typical type of problem in science and engineering that has a tradition of stimulating the advancement of mechanical/electrical calculation. This tradition starts with the nature and the economics of the calculation problems tackled by Pascal, Leibniz, Turing, Mauchly and Eckert, von Neumann and many others. In the case of AI-ESTATE the advancement is partially stimulated by the economics of system test and diagnosis, the impact of the decoupling of diagnostic decision making from the rest of the Test Environment, and the impact of the people that worked together to provide the IEEE 1232 Standard. The advantages of declarative languages is discussed over the disadvantages of imperative languages in a general context.

Apart from the market actors, the experts being in direct contacts with these actors (for example, conducting in-depth interviews) could be aware of these rules. Generally speaking, social and economic regularities are generated by the fact that people behave according to the socially constructed rules which are explained, argued and learnt through telling stories. It means that we should analyze these stories for revealing the social and economic regularities. As far as the modern economics is not interested in studying economic actors' discourses, it loses a capacity to understand and foresee important economic phenomena. Discourse analysis does not imply a departure from the strict scientific standards with their origins in natural sciences; it rather comes closer to them because all social interactions are mediated by language. The paper proposes an alternative to a variety of forms developed by institutional economics as well as most recent perspectives of economic theory including behavioral and experimental economics. The first part of the paper published in the current issue of the journal (May 2011) describes discursive methodology and its recent applications to the analysis of economic phenomena. The second part of the paper will be published in the next journal issue (September 2011). It is devoted to a discursive analysis of history and the present status of economics. It revises the results of Methodenstreit and discusses conditions which could give a way to the radical reform of mainstream economics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1726-3247,,,,,MAY,2011,12,3,,,,,15,+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000420536000003,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Yu, J",,,,"Yu, Juan",,,Revolutionizing industrial park waste classification with artificial intelligence: A behavioral economics and evolutionary game theory perspective,PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION,,,,,,,,,,,,"Industrial waste classification is vital for sustainable manufacturing; however, traditional methods face challenges such as high costs, behavioral inertia, and fragmented strategies that overlook dynamic interdepartmental collaboration. Artificial intelligence (AI) presents transformative potential to overcome these barriers, but existing studies fail to integrate behavioral economics and evolutionary dynamics, limiting their ability to stabilize compliance in diverse industrial parks. This study proposes a novel framework combining behavioral economics with evolutionary game theory (EGT) to explore AI-enhanced waste management dynamics across various industrial park types. Behavioral insights examine how cognitive biases, such as loss aversion and social proof, influence employee compliance with waste classification policies in AI-driven environments. Concurrently, EGT simulations model interdepartmental cooperation and strategy evolution in waste management. Results indicate that AI-based behavioral interventions, including real-time feedback and incentive mechanisms, increase compliance rates by 22 % and foster interdepartmental collaboration to maximize eco-efficiency. In gated industrial parks, strict regulation combined with AI-driven monitoring accelerates the stabilization of compliant behaviors, achieving equilibrium 40 % faster than traditional models. In open parks, social and moral incentives are essential, requiring a moral constraint threshold (theta) of 0.8 for stable compliance. A case study at Suzhou Industrial Park demonstrates a 52 % reduction in mixed waste disposal, 90 % accuracy in AI-driven classification, and a 30 % reduction in policy costs, underscoring the framework's scalability. This study provides actionable insights for policymakers and industry leaders seeking to optimize waste management in diverse regulatory environments and highlights AI's transformative role in promoting sustainable manufacturing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0957-5820,1744-3598,,,,MAY,2025,197,,,,,,,,107043,10.1016/j.psep.2025.107043,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2025.107043,,MAR 2025,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001456717100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Abdus; Ashraf, Imran",,,Artificial Intelligence and Behavioral Economics: A Bibliographic Analysis of Research Field,IEEE ACCESS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Behavioral economics and artificial intelligence (AI) have been two rapidly growing fields of research over the past few years. While behavioral economics aims to combine concepts from psychology, sociology, and neuroscience with classical economic thoughts to understand human decision-making processes in the complex economic environment, AI on the other hand, focuses on creating intelligent machines that can mimic human cognitive abilities such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and language understanding. The intersection of these two fields has led to thrilling research theories and practical applications. This study provides a bibliometric analysis of the literature on AI and behavioral economics to gain insight into research trends in this field. We conducted this bibliometric analysis using the Web of Science database on articles published between 2012 and 2022 that were related to AI and behavioral economics. VOSviewer and Bibliometrix R package were utilized to identify influential authors, journals, institutions, and countries in the field. Network analysis was also performed to identify the main research themes and their interrelationships. The analysis revealed that the number of publications on AI and behavioral economics has been increasing steadily over the past decade. We found that most studies focused on customer and consumer behavior, including topics such as decision-making under uncertainty, neuroeconomics, and behavioral game theory, combined mainly with machine learning and deep learning techniques. We also identified several emerging themes, including the use of AI in nudging and prospect theory in behavioral finance, as well as undeveloped themes such as AI-driven behavioral macroeconomics. The findings suggests that there is a need for more interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers in behavioral economics and AI. We also suggest that future research on AI and behavioral economics further consider the ethical implications of using AI and behavioral insights in decision-making.

What about if you find out you were unfairly discriminated against by an AI decision-making tool that was being supervised by an HR professional? Should the developer compensate you, the company that procured the software, or the (employer of the) HR professional that was supervising the system's output? These questions do not have easy answers. In the European Union and elsewhere around the world, AI governance is turning towards risk regulation. Risk regulation alone is, however, rarely optimal. The situations above all involve the liability for harms that are caused by or with an AI system. While risk regulations like the AI Act regulate some aspects of these human and machine interactions, they do not offer those impacted by AI systems any rights and little avenues to seek redress. From a corrective justice perspective risk regulation must also be complemented by liability law because when harms do occur, harmed individuals should be compensated. From a risk-prevention perspective, risk regulation may still fall short of creating optimal incentives for all parties to take precautions. Because risk regulation is not enough, scholars and regulators around the world have highlighted that AI regulations should be complemented by liability rules to address AI harms when they occur.

It is a master plan that builds upon the EU AI High-Level Expert Group guidelines. This article reviews the masterplan, from a culture cycle perspective, to reflect on its potential clashes with current societal, technical, and methodological constraints. We identify two main obstacles in the implementation of this plan: (i) the lack of a coherent EU vision to drive future decision-making processes at state and local levels and (ii) the lack of methods to support a sustainable diffusion of AI in our society. The lack of a coherent vision stems from not considering societal differences across the EU member states. We suggest that these differences may lead to a fractured market and an AI crisis in which different members of the EU will adopt nation-centric strategies to exploit AI, thus preventing the development of a frictionless market as envisaged by the EU. Moreover, the Commission aims at changing the AI development culture proposing a human-centred and safety-first perspective that is not supported by methodological advancements, thus taking the risks of unforeseen social and societal impacts of AI. We discuss potential societal, technical, and methodological gaps that should be filled to avoid the risks of developing AI systems at the expense of society. Our analysis results in the recommendation that the EU regulators and policymakers consider how to complement the EC programme with rules and compensatory mechanisms to avoid market fragmentation due to local and global ambitions. Moreover, regulators should go beyond the human-centred approach establishing a research agenda seeking answers to the technical and methodological open questions regarding the development and assessment of human-AI co-action aiming for a sustainable AI diffusion in the society.",,,,,"Wolterink, Jelmer/K-1242-2019; Wijnhoven, Fons/M-8010-2019; Zurita-Milla, Raul/E-9333-2010; Kounadi, Ourania/HNR-1571-2023; Yang, Michael Ying/AAC-6698-2019; Le, Duc/LTE-8688-2024; Wang, Mingshu/I-1533-2014; Wijnhoven, Fons/B-4960-2010; Nex, Francesco/G-9264-2018; Brune, Christoph/C-1700-2013; Lehtola, Ville/G-1101-2014","Augustijn, Ellen-Wien/0000-0002-3389-7585; Wang, Mingshu/0000-0001-5260-3143; Wijnhoven, Fons/0000-0001-8231-7535; Nex, Francesco/0000-0002-5712-6902; Li, Jamy/0000-0003-2440-9719; VanDerNagel, Joanne/0000-0002-7641-9890; Brune, Christoph/0000-0003-0145-5069; Veldkamp, Bernard/0000-0003-3543-2164; Wolterink, Jelmer/0000-0001-5505-475X; Borsci, Simone/0000-0002-3591-3577; bagheriye, leila/0000-0003-1605-5850; Moreira, Joao/0000-0002-4547-7000; Kounadi, Ourania/0000-0002-5998-7343; Yang, Michael Ying/0000-0002-0649-9987; Lehtola, Ville/0000-0001-8856-5919",,,,,,,,,,,,,0951-5666,1435-5655,,,,AUG,2023,38,4,,,SI,,1465,1484,,10.1007/s00146-021-01383-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-021-01383-x,,JAN 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000745579200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

From March to May 2023, the AI Education (AIEDN) research project investigated how an AI-based learning assistant can compensate for existing impediments by enabling a better understanding through video-based learning. For this study, 275 students were selected from two secondary schools (N=137) and two grammar schools (N=138) in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. The experiment tested the extent to which learners solve more tasks, build broader (transfer) knowledge, and retain it. Students were repeatedly tested on mathematical problems, where the control group did not have access to the AI assistant. In contrast, the other group used the AI assistant to solve the problems. The students' performances from both school groups were statistically tested using t-tests. Within the test group of grammar schools, a significant change in the results between the two test days existed (T(41)=-2,28; p<.01) when the AI tool was used. In contrast, the control group showed no significant change T(37)=-.42; p>.05; d=.07) in performance.

However, investors of conventional energy assets have yet to consider the rapidly emerging AI-based assets for diversification. Owing to the rise of new categories of assets in the last two decades, which has sparked the interest of global investors to attain the most favorable outcomes, we examine volatility connectedness between AI stocks (MSFT-Microsoft, GOOG-Alphabet, AMZN-Amazon), AI tokens (AGIX-SingularityNET, OCEAN-Ocean Protocol, FET-Fetch.ai), and fossil fuel markets (WTI, BRENT, and GAS-natural gas) over the period from May 6, 2019, to July 8, 2023. We apply a novel three-dimensional framework in which we model time-domain and frequency-domain volatility spillovers at the median-, lower- and upper-quantiles in static as well as dynamic settings to achieve the objectives of this paper. We find the variation in static and dynamic connectedness between markets over timefrequencies and quantiles. Results reveal that AGIX, BRENT, FET, MSFT, and WTI are recipients, whereas AMZN, GAS, GOOG, and OCEAN are transmitters of the spillovers at the median quantile. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the short-term and long-term metrics for dynamic total connectedness might not consistently exhibit the same direction. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the short-term fluctuations predominantly influence the network's overall shock transmission, while the longer-term aspect has the potential to alter the role of a net transmitter or receiver of shocks.

A recent study found that when judges were given decision-support, it ended up increasing disparities-not because the algorithm was biased-in fact the algorithm would have resulted in lower disparities. But the judges selectively paid attention to the algorithm, which resulted in greater disparities. This article argues for an incremental approach leveraging recent theoretical insights from social preference economics. The core insight is that judges are moral decision-makers-you're right or wrong, good or bad-and to understand what motivates these decision-makers, one might turn to self-image motives-a topic of active behavioral research in recent years. Each stage leverages motives related to the self: self-image, self-improvement, self-understanding, and ego. In stage 1, people use AI as a support tool, speeding up existing processes (for example, by prefilling forms). Once they're used to this, they can more easily accept an added functionality (Stage 2) in which AI becomes a choice monitor, pointing out choice inconsistencies and reminding the human of her prior choices in similar situations. Stage 3 elevates the AI to the role of a more general coach, providing outcome feedback on choices and highlighting decision patterns. Then, in stage 4, the AI brings in other people's decision histories and patterns, serving as a platform for a community of experts.

The study employs a game-theoretic model to examine AI identity disclosure strategies, incorporating consumer preferences for algorithms and their ability to detect undisclosed AI usage. Findings indicate that nondisclosure is ineffective in markets with a high proportion of sophisticated consumers who can recognize AI involvement. However, in markets dominated by naive consumers, where AI identity is less detectable, disclosure remains the preferred strategy, particularly when AI service quality is perceived as low, to mitigate potential backlash. Comparing pure AI and human-AI collaboration service modes, merchants derive greater benefits from nondisclosure in collaboration settings. Furthermore, greater consumer aversion to AI does not necessarily push merchants toward nondisclosure, as its effectiveness depends on service quality rather than aversion alone. This study also highlights the dual role of AI anthropomorphism: it can increase consumer acceptance of nondisclosure while simultaneously making disclosure more appealing. Under nondisclosure, improvements in service quality generally enhance consumer surplus, but sophisticated consumers may gain less surplus than naive consumers. Lastly, mandating AI identity transparency does not always maximize social welfare, challenging the assumption that compulsory disclosure is universally beneficial. These findings offer valuable insights into human-AI collaboration and inform the design of algorithm transparency policies in AI-driven services.",,,,,"Ding, Zhenbin/GQI-0510-2022; Zhang, Yali/R-8627-2019; Yang, Zhaojun/G-7707-2019","Sun, Jun/0000-0002-0325-1951; Ding, Zhenbin/0000-0003-0346-1649; Zhang, Yali/0000-0001-6158-1791",,,,,,,,,,,,,0925-5273,1873-7579,,,,MAY,2025,283,,,,,,,,109564,10.1016/j.ijpe.2025.109564,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2025.109564,,MAR 2025,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001441160300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This gap is especially notable when considering the type of crowdsourcing participants (e.g., general crowd versus specialists) and the pace of technological change in the business landscape, as critical factors in developing digital service using crowdsourcing-enabled AI tools. Drawing on a cross-industry sample of firms collected through an online survey, our findings reveal that involving both the general crowd and specialists contributes to value creation by enhancing customer relationships, improving production and operations, and advancing product and service development. However, in environments characterized by rapid technological change (i.e., high technological turbulence), the involvement of specialists with expert knowledge becomes essential for value creation.

One potential solution to increase the productivity and efficiency of the federal government is to adopt AI technologies and devices. AI technologies and devices already provide unique capabilities, services, and products, as demonstrated by smart homes, autonomous vehicles, delivery drones, GPS navigation, Chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, and virtual assistants such as Amazon's Alexa. However, incorporating massive AI into the US federal government would present several challenges, including ethical and legal concerns, outdated infrastructure, unprepared human capital, institutional obstacles, and a lack of social acceptance. How can US policymakers promote policies that increase AI usage in the face of these challenges? This will require a comprehensive strategy at the intersection of science, policy, and economics that addresses the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we survey literature on the interrelated policy process to understand the advancement, or lack thereof, of AI in the US federal government, an emerging area of interest. To accomplish this, we examine several policy process frameworks, including the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), Multiple Streams Framework (MSF), Punctuated Equilibrium Theory (PET), Internal Determinants and Diffusion (ID&D), Narrative Policy Framework (NPF), and Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD).

Specifically, as a result of this analysis, it identifies and evaluates seven detection techniques of trust stemming from the action research conducted in the Horizon Europe Lighthouse project called ENFIELD: (i) federated learning for decentralized AI detection, (ii) blockchain-based provenance tracking, (iii) zero-knowledge proofs for content authentication, (iv) DAOs for crowdsourced verification, (v) AI-powered digital watermarking, (vi) explainable AI (XAI) for content detection, and (vii) privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). By leveraging these approaches, the framework strengthens AI governance through peer-to-peer (P2P) structures while addressing the socio-political challenges of AI-driven misinformation. Ultimately, this research contributes to the development of resilient democratic systems in an era of increasing technopolitical polarization.",,,,,"Calzada, Igor/H-9662-2017; Al-Radhi, Mohammed Salah/C-9727-2018","Calzada, Igor/0000-0002-4269-830X; Al-Radhi, Mohammed Salah/0000-0003-3094-6916",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2504-2289,,,,MAR 6,2025,9,3,,,,,,,62,10.3390/bdcc9030062,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bdcc9030062,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001453066100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool to bridge this demand-supply gap, with potential applications ranging from full automation to integrated AI-human decision-making. This study evaluates the economic feasibility of incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into mammography screening within healthcare settings, considering full or partial integration. To evaluate the economic viability, we employ an optimization model specifically designed to minimize mammography screening costs. This model considers three distinct approaches when interpreting mammograms: automation strategy utilizing AI exclusively, delegation strategy involving the selective allocation of tasks between radiologists and AI, and the expert-alone strategy relying solely on radiologist decisions. Our findings underscore the significance of disease prevalence in relation to the trade-off between costs associated with false positives (e.g., follow-up expenses) and false negatives (e.g., litigation costs stemming from missed diagnoses) in shaping the AI strategy for healthcare organizations. We backtest our approach using data from an AI contest in which participants aimed to match or surpass radiologists' performance in assessing screening mammograms for women. The contest data supports the optimality of the delegation strategy, potentially leading to cost savings of 17.5% to 30.1% compared to relying solely on human experts.

Cows were synchronized for TAI starting at 62 and 42 d in milk in herds 1 and 2, respectively. The OvSynch regimen included: GnRH (buserelin) at 0.02 mg (i.m.) on d 0; PGF(2alpha) (tiaprost) at 0.75 mg (i.m.) on d 7; buserelin at 0.02 mg (i. m.) on d 9; and TAI 16 to 20 h later. After TAI, cows seen in estrus received AI, whereas cows diagnosed not pregnant were resynchronized for TAI. Control cows received AI based on detected estrus after voluntary waiting periods of 72 d in herd 1 and 50 d in herd 2. An economic analysis included costs associated with days open, culling, AI, synchrony products, treatment, and examinations. A sensitivity analysis of those variables determined effects on total costs per pregnancy. Use of OvSynch reduced intervals to first AI and days open in both herds and reduced culling for infertility in herd 2. Conception rates for first AI at detected estrus were significantly higher compared to TAI in both herds and for overall AI at estrus in herd 2. For groups assigned to AI at estrus, mean 21-d submission rates over 200 d for AI were higher in herd 1 than in herd 2 (55.6 vs. 28.6%). Days open and culling were the major cost factors. Although OvSynch improved reproduction in both herds, AI based on detected estrus was economically superior in herd 1, whereas OvSynch was superior in herd 2. This was consistent across ranges of cost factors evaluated. Evaluation of synchrony protocols should include reproductive performance along with appropriate costs associated with treatments. Such costs may offset benefits to reproduction in herds with good estrous detection rates.",,,,,,"Drillich, Marc/0000-0002-2824-8185",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0302,1525-3198,,,,JAN,2004,87,1,,,,,85,94,,10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(04)73145-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(04)73145-8,,,,,,,,14765814,,,,,WOS:000187665400011,View Full Record in Web of Science

We develop an analytical model to examine how an artificial intelligence (AI) cloud service provider optimally sets security investments and price discounts, considering users' different views of public, private, and hybrid AI cloud services. Our results show how end users' characteristics and market dynamics affect these strategies and reveal the balance providers must strike between improving user experiences, capturing market share, and maximizing profits. We find that the provider's control over AI cloud security-along with security costs for both the provider and users, as well as users' potential security losses-plays a critical role in shaping effective strategies. In lowsecurity-loss environments, end users gain more from choosing public AI cloud solutions. However, private AI cloud solutions become more favorable if the provider's security cost coefficient falls within certain limits. In the hybrid AI cloud scenario, the model becomes more complex. Under some conditions, security investment and price discounts act as complementary strategies; in others, they substitute for one another.

In recent years, scholars with interests in these diverse fields have formulated similar research questions, investigated similar research contexts, and even often adopted similar methodologies when studying AI. Despite these commonalities, the AI management literature has largely evolved in an isolated fashion within specific fields, thereby impeding the development of cumulative knowledge. Moreover, views of AI's anticipated trajectory have often oscillated between unjustifiably optimistic assessments of its benefits and extremely pessimistic appraisals of the risks it poses for organizations and society. Method: To move beyond the polarized discussion, this work offers a systematic review of the vast, interdisciplinary AI management literature, based on analysis of a large sample of articles published between 2010 and 2022. Results: We identify four main research streams in the AI management literature and associated, conflicting discussion, concerning four (data, labor, critical, and value) dimensions. Conclusion: The review conceptually and practically contributes to the IS field by documenting the literature's evolution and highlighting avenues for future research trajectories.

As a result, many new applications of AI in medicine, especially Radiology, have been introduced. This resurgence in AI, and its diverse clinical and nonclinical applications throughout healthcare, requires a thorough understanding to reap the potential benefits and avoid the potential pitfalls. MethodsTo realize the full potential of AI in medicine, a highly coordinated approach should be undertaken to select, support and finance more highly focused AI projects. By studying and understanding the successes and failures, and strengths and limitations, of AI in Radiology, it is possible to seek and develop the most clinically relevant AI algorithms. The authors have reviewed their clinical practice regarding the use of AI to determine applications in which AI can add both clinical and remunerative benefits. ResultsReview of our policies and applications regarding AI in the Department of Radiology emphasized that, at the time of this writing, AI has been useful in the detection of specific clinical entities for which the AI algorithms have been designed. In addition to helping to reduce diagnostic errors, AI offers an important opportunity to prioritize positive cases, such as pulmonary embolism or intracranial hemorrhage. It has become apparent that the detection of certain conditions, such as incidental and unsuspected cerebral aneurysms can be used to initiate a variety of patient-oriented activities. Finding an unsuspected brain aneurysm is not only of clinical importance to the patient, but the required clinical workup and management of the patient can help generate reimbursement that helps defray the cost of AI implementations. A program for screening, clinical management, and follow-up, facilitated by the AI detection of incidental brain aneurysms, has been implemented at our multi-hospital healthcare system.

Two issues have gained particular attention: algorithmic price discrimination (PD) and algorithmic tacit collusion (TC). Although the risks and opportunities of both practices have been explored extensively in the literature, neither has yet been observed in the actual practice. As a result, there remains much confusion as to the ability of algorithms to engage in potentially harmful behavior with respect to price discrimination and collusion. In this article, we embed the economic and legal literature on these topics in a technological grounding to provide a more objective account of the capabilities of current AI technologies to engage in price discrimination and collusion.

This research systematically compares the performance of AI-generated to human-made marketing images across important marketing dimensions. First, we prompt seven stateof-the-art generative text-to-image models (DALL-E 3, Midjourney v6, Firefly 2, Imagen 2, Imagine, Stable Diffusion XL Turbo, and Realistic Vision) to create 10 320 synthetic marketing images, using 2 400 real-world, human-made images as input. 254 400 human evaluations of these images show that AI-generated marketing imagery can surpass human-made images in quality, realism, and aesthetics. Second, we give identical creative briefings to commissioned human freelancers and the AI models, showing that the best synthetic images also excel in ad creativity, ad attitudes, and prompt following. Third, a field study with more than 173 000 impressions demonstrates that AI-generated banner ads can compete with professional human-made stock photography, achieving an up to 50 gest that the paradigm shift brought about by generative AI can help advertisers produce marketing content not only faster and orders of magnitude cheaper but also at superhuman effectiveness levels with important implications for firms, consumers, and policymakers.

This technology likely will become commercially available in many countries within a few years. Accuracy of the process is about 90% for either sex, and resulting calves appear to be no different from non-sexed controls in birthweight, mortality, rate of gain, and incidence of abnormalities. The main determinants of the extent of use of sexed sperm will be pregnancy rate and cost. Fertility of low doses (1.5 x 10(6)-2 x 10(6)) of sexed, frozen sperm for AI of heifers usually has been in the range of 70-80% of unsexed sperm at normal doses (10 x 10(6)-20 x 10(6) sperm) in well managed herds; it has been lower in poorly managed herds, and likely will be lower with lactating dairy cows. It is expected that fertility of sexed sperm will increase significantly due to very recent improvements in the hydrodynamics of the sexing process and potential improvements in cryopreservation procedures. It is unclear how sexed sperm will be priced; the cost of sexed sperm for cattle will likely be more than double the cost of unsexed sperm in most markets. The economic benefit of using sexed sperm also will depend on the baseline fertility of the herd since at lower fertility, it takes more doses of semen per calf produced. It is noted that for a small percentage of elite cattle, the economics of using sexed sperm do not depend primarily on increased production or efficiency of producing meat or milk, but rather on factors such as scarcity, tradition, cattle show winnings, and biosecurity during herd expansion. Until sorting efficiencies improve and costs decline, sales likely will be limited primarily to these niche markets. With near normal fertility and a premium for sexing in the range of US$ 10 per insemination dose, sexed sperm likely would become economically and environmentally beneficial for many, if not most populations of cattle being bred by AI.

These AI algorithms are capable of creating visually appealing and realistic representations of food and other products. However, the impact of AI-generated product photos on consumer perception and engagement remains relatively unexplored. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this article is to examine the differences between AI-generated product photos of food and photos taken by real photographers using neuromarketing techniques, specifically eye tracking and facial recognition. By employing these techniques, we aim to gain insights into the visual attention patterns, emotional responses, and preference for AI-generated versus real photographer's images. Methods: In this study, a sample of participants was exposed to AI-generated product photos and real photographer's images of food. Eye tracking technology was used to measure participants' visual attention patterns, capturing which elements of the photos attracted their gaze and for how long. Self-report measures were used to collect data on participants' preference. Findings & Value added: The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the differences between AI-generated product photos and photos from real photographers. Participants reported higher purchase intent and perceived brand quality when exposed to real photographer's images. The value added by this research lies in its contribution to understanding the impact of AI-generated product photos on consumer perception and engagement.

A comprehensive survey of Romanian university students, focusing on economics students, was undertaken. This study identifies critical latent factors and investigates their interrelationships by employing advanced analytical techniques, such as Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), with robust standard errors. The results suggest that formal training and integration, concerns regarding AI, perceived utility, and positive attitudes towards AI are positively influenced by general awareness and familiarity with AI tools. The frequency of AI tool usage is substantially increased by perceived usefulness, positive attitudes, and formal training and integration. Conversely, positive attitudes and perceived utility are adversely affected by AI-related concerns. Indirect effects suggest that formal training and positive attitudes indirectly increase the usage frequency by increasing general awareness.

The paper reviews the existing research and discusses its merits. This review highlights the need for subsequent conceptual reconfigurations of business model theory, the theory of data network effects, and the theory of situated AI for competitive advantage. The integration of these three theories leads to a novel theory: AI-enabled business models for competitive advantage. This paper contributes to the broad literature on technology management, and more specifically to literature on technology-enabled business models and the use of AI.

This also motivates dMRFs to adopt an AI quality control system to eliminate contamination. We build a game-theoretic model to analyze the decision-makers' incentive of AI adoption and interesting findings include: (1) Even AI quality control pushes the purchasing price upward, dMRF's supply quantity can be surprisingly reduced, indicating inefficient use of AI; (2) AI quality control cost and the manufacturer's waste disposal cost exhibit a substitutable relationship in promoting the dMRF's AI adoption. These findings provide important insights for managers in formulating purchasing strategies, investment decisions, and AI adoption.

Users' Perceptions of Human Versus AI Decision-Making and the Power of Explainable-AI,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION,,,,,,,,,,,,"With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) based systems, a new era has begun. Decisions that were once made by humans are now increasingly being made by these advanced systems, with the inevitable consequence of our growing reliance on AI in many aspects of our lives. At the same time, the opaque nature of AI-based systems and the possibility of unintentional or hidden discriminatory practices and biases raises profound questions not only about the mechanics of AI, but also about how users perceive the fairness of these systems. We hypothesize that providing various explanations for AI decision-making processes and output may enhance users' fairness perceptions and make them trust the system and adopt its decisions. Hence, we devised an online between-subject experiment that explores users' fairness and comprehension perceptions of AI systems with respect to the explanations provided by the system, employing a case study of a managerial decision in the human resources (HR) domain. We manipulated (i) the decision-maker (AI or human); (ii) the input (candidate characteristics); (iii) the output (recommendation valence), and (iv) the explanation style. We examined the effect of the various manipulations (and individuals' demographic and personality characteristics) using multivariate ordinal regression. We also performed a multi-level analysis of experiment components to examine the effects of the decision-maker type, explanation style, and their combination. The results suggest three main conclusions. The first conclusion is that there is a gap in users' fairness and comprehension perception of AI-based decision making systems compared to human decision making. The second conclusion is that knowing that an AI-based system provided the decisions negatively affects users' fairness and comprehension perceptions, compared to knowing that humans made the decision. Finally, the third conclusion is that providing case-based, certification-based, or sensitivity-based explanations can narrow this gap and may even eliminate it. Additionally, we found that users' fairness and comprehension perceptions are influenced by a variety of factors such as the input, output, and explanation provided by the system, as well as by individuals' age, education, computer skills, and personality. Our findings may help to understand when and how to use explanations to improve users' perceptions regarding AI-based decision-making.

However, suitable input might not be available or may require extensive data collection. Data sharing is one option to address these issues, but it is generally impractical because of privacy concerns or due to the problematic process of finding a sharing agreement. Instead, this work considers knowledge sharing by first exchanging the weights of pretrained DNNs and then applying transfer learning (TL). Specifically, it addresses the economics of knowledge sharing in AI services by taking a market-based approach. In detail, a model based on Fisher's market is devised for optimal knowledge sharing, defined as the gain in inference accuracy from exchanging DNN weights. The proposed approach is shown to reach a market equilibrium and to satisfy important economic properties, including Pareto optimality. A technique for weight fusion is also introduced to merge acquired knowledge with the existing one. Finally, an extensive evaluation is conducted in a distributed intelligence scenario. The obtained results show that the proposed solution is efficient and that weight fusion with TL significantly increases inference accuracy compared to the original DNN, without the overhead of federated learning.",,,,,"Mohammed, Thaha/I-9187-2019; Mohammed, Thaha/D-3671-2017; Sigg, Stephan/M-2866-2015","naas, si-ahmed/0000-0002-4019-938X; Mohammed, Thaha/0000-0002-4767-4147; Sigg, Stephan/0000-0001-6118-3355",,,,,,,,,,,,,2327-4662,,,,,JAN 15,2023,10,2,,,,,1320,1331,,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3206585,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2022.3206585,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001011036600028,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Risk Priority Number (RPN) approach has been criticized for its flaws since it calculates the product of severity, occurrence, and detection ratings of threats. By considering a variety of criteria and aspects, and by thoughtfully and carefully combining expert perspectives, the proposed FMEA model may more accurately evaluate the risks associated with AI in Education. Picture Fuzzy Sets (PFSs) and Grey Relational Analysis-TOPSIS (GRA-TOPSIS) are combined to achieve this. The goal of this research is to use an updated FMEA model to assess and rank the risk hierarchy of the seven identified hazards. According to the data, algorithmic risk is the most significant issue that requires urgent attention. Relevant constraints and suggestions are also provided to encourage research on the dangers of AI in Education.

Secondly, they judged whether-after deciding to delegate the research process-they would trust the scientist (that decided to delegate) to oversee future projects. Thirdly, they rated the expected accuracy and quality of the output from the delegated research process. Our results show that people judged delegating to an LLM as less morally acceptable than delegating to a human (d = -0.78).

This has led to the emergence of 'AI anxiety'-a stress response to potential impacts of AI on individuals' futures. This study examines AI anxiety's effects on individuals' willingness to pay for knowledge, focusing on the roles of perceived value and self-efficacy.MethodsThis study consisted of two experiments. Study 1 utilized a one-factor between-subjects design (AI anxiety vs. neutral emotion) with 297 participants to examine the mediating role of perceived value in the relationship between AI anxiety and willingness to pay for knowledge. Study 2 employed a 2 x 2 between-subjects design (AI anxiety vs. neutral emotion )xself-efficacy (high vs. low) with 506 participants to investigate the moderating effect of self-efficacy on this relationship.ResultsStudy 1 showed that AI anxiety significantly increases the willingness to pay for knowledge, with perceived value partially mediating this effect. Study 2 demonstrated that self-efficacy moderates the influence of AI anxiety: higher self-efficacy levels weaken, whereas lower levels strengthen, the willingness to pay for knowledge. Furthermore, self-efficacy also negatively moderates the effect of AI anxiety on perceived value.ConclusionsAI anxiety positively influences payment for knowledge, with critical roles for perceived value and self-efficacy.

This paper presents a categorization of AI risks highlighted in public discourse, as reflected in written online media accounts, to provide a background for its primary focus: exploring the dimensions of AI threats that receive insufficient attention. Particular emphasis is dedicated to the ignored issues of animal welfare and the psychological impacts on humans, the latter of which surprisingly remains inadequately addressed despite the prevalent anthropocentric perspective of the public conversation. Moreover, this work also considers other underexplored dangers of AI development for the environment and, hypothetically, for sentient AI. The methodology of this study is grounded in a manual selection and meticulous, thematic, and discourse analytical manual examination of online articles published in the aftermath of the AI surge following ChatGPT's launch in late 2022. This qualitative approach is specifically designed to overcome the limitations of automated, surface-level evaluations typically used in media reviews, aiming to provide insights and nuances often missed by the mechanistic and algorithm-driven methods prevalent in contemporary research. Through this detail-oriented investigation, a categorization of the dominant themes in the discourse on AI hazards was developed to identify its overlooked aspects. Stemming from this evaluation, the paper argues for expanding risk assessment frameworks in public thinking to a morally more inclusive approach. It calls for a more comprehensive acknowledgment of the potential harm of AI technology's progress to non-human animals, the environment, and, more theoretically, artificial agents possibly attaining sentience.

With the rapid advancement of digital technologies, online advertising has become essential for eff ective brand communication with target audiences in digital spaces. Problem Statement. It has been hypothesized that artificial intelligence (AI) tools can enhance the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, leading to increased sales, higher profits for advertisers, and improved returns on marketing investments. Purpose. This study aims to examine the impact of AI tools on managing consumer behavior in digital marketing. Material and Methods. An experiment has been conducted on the Meta Ads platform to compare the outcomes of advertising campaigns confi gured with AI tools versus manual settings. Two test groups of advertising campaigns have been selected based on the competence and awareness of the management targets. Using Kohonen maps, the reflexive characteristics of the management targets in these groups have been assessed. By employing both manual settings and AI tools, an experiment has been carried out by a digital marketing specialist to modify potential customers' reflexive characteristics and investigate changes in their behavior regarding targeted actions within the advertising campaigns. Results have been compared across both configurations. Results. The study has shown that AI tools enable effective influence on user behavior in digital spaces. AI-gene rated recommendations have led to increased reach, clicks, and conversions from ad links, with the greatest efficiency observed when targeting potential customers. Potential areas for further research have also been identified. Conclusions. Leveraging AI tools in Meta Ads campaigns enables advertisers to increase product sales and improve returns on marketing investments.",,,,,"Svitlana, Turlakova/B-7771-2018","Svitlana, Turlakova/0000-0002-3954-8503; Shumilo, Yana/0000-0001-7726-4037",,,,,,,,,,,,,2409-9066,2413-4996,,,,,2025,21,1,,,,,67,81,,10.15407/scine21.01.067,http://dx.doi.org/10.15407/scine21.01.067,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001410904300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

A one-scale law arising in either macroeconomics or microeconomics might be mathematically correct and economically relevant, however, sparking debates might arise for a different scale. This paper re-analyzes the basic assumptions of the Evans model for dynamic economics, and it concludes that they are quite reasonable on a large time-scale, but the assumptions become totally invalid on a smaller scale, and a fractal modification has to be adopted. A two-scale price dynamics is suggested and a fractal variational theory is established to maximize the profit at a given period. Furthermore Evans 1924 variational principle for the maximal profit is easy to be solved for a quadratic cost function using the Lagrange multiplier method. Here a quadratic-cubic cost function and a nonlinear demand function are used, and the stationary condition of the variational formulation is derived step by step, and a more complex dynamic system is obtained.

This paper aims to address this gap by exploring this issue through the theoretical perspective of lay belief, which suggests that AI recommendations, often thought to rely on collective wisdom, may overlook individual idiosyncratic preferences.Design/methodology/approachA survey (involving 159 consumers) is conducted to provide general evidence (across product categories) for the impact of perceived preference heterogeneity on consumer acceptance of AI-driven recommendations. Three follow-up experiments with 597 participants provide causal evidence and examine the mediating role of cognitive trust (versus affective trust) as well as the moderating role of recommendation framing and the human likeness of the AI recommender.FindingsPerceived preference heterogeneity negatively affects consumer acceptance of AI-driven recommendations, which is caused by decreased cognitive (rather than affective) trust. The effect is eliminated when the unfavorable lay belief is attenuated by a personal-based (versus others-based) recommendation framing and by increasing the AI recommender's human likeness in cognitive ability or appearance.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper conducts survey and lab experiments, and future research may use field experiments to provide further evidence. Future research may extend the study to categories where consumers are highly uncertain about their own preference and use highly humanlike AI recommenders.Practical implicationsCompanies may highlight the personalization nature of the recommendations rather than the powerful and collaborative recommendation process. When consumers perceive high preference heterogeneity, companies would better use personal-based framings and increase the AI recommender's human likeness in cognitive ability or appearance.Originality/valueThis research shows that perceived preference heterogeneity is an important antecedent that hinders consumer acceptance of AI-driven recommendations because of consumers' unfavorable lay belief. This research also suggests that AI (when adopted to offer product recommendations) may not generate positive responses even in the cognitive domain, whereas most research focuses on its lack of affective abilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0309-0566,1758-7123,,,,2025 MAY 6,2025,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/EJM-02-2023-0082,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJM-02-2023-0082,,MAY 2025,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001481019200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drawing on French and Raven's (1959) bases of power, as well as resource dependence theory, we propose a conceptual model that shows how AI providers centralize control and reshape power relations. As AI integrates into servitization, providers leverage informational and expert power through data management and algorithmic expertise, alongside legitimate and referent power, to influence behaviours, promote risk-taking, foster dependency, and establish themselves as central authorities setting standards and norms. They further exploit coercive and reward power to impose conditions and offer incentives that deepen platform reliance, ultimately dominating the ecosystem and establishing a quasi-monopolistic position.

GenAI has the potential to open new avenues of research and design in augmenting feedback practices by providing innovative, personalized, and scalable feedback solutions. The study investigates how GenAI functionalities, specifically ChatGPT explanation features and GenAI-powered dashboard visualizations, can support students in engaging with feedback. Using feedback literacy theory, a thematic analysis was conducted and triangulated with usage trace data to assess students' perceptions of these functionalities. The study involved three key activities: introductory lab sessions, in-semester use of the GenAI-powered LA feedback tool, and post hoc interviews, with data collected from 18 students from various disciplines (information technology, education, business and economics, and engineering) throughout all phases. Initial findings from the lab sessions showed positive perceptions of the GenAI functionalities. However, trace data from in-semester use indicated modest engagement with GenAI. Post hoc interviews revealed that reduced engagement was due to a mismatch between the GenAI outputs and student expectations. While some students appreciated the GenAI functionalities, others found them redundant when they perceived the feedback as clear and easy to understand.

The chest X-ray (CXR) remains the primary screening tool to identify lung cancers in the UK; however, there is a shortfall of radiologists, while demand continues to increase. Image analysis by machine-learning software has the potential to support radiology workflows with a focus on immediate triage of suspicious X-rays. The RADICAL study will evaluate Qure.ai's 'qXR' software in reducing reporting time for suspicious X-rays in NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde.Methods and analysis This is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised study consisting of a retrospective technical evaluation and prospective clinical effectiveness study alongside the assessment of acceptability via qualitative work and evaluation of cost-effectiveness via a cost utility analysis. The primary objective is to assess the clinical effectiveness of qXR to prioritise patients suspected with lung cancer on CXR for follow-up CT. Secondary objectives will look at the utility, safety, technical performance, health economics and acceptability of the intervention. The study period is 24 months, consisting of an initial 12 month data collection period and a 12 month follow-up period. All the standard care CXRs from outpatient and primary care requests will be securely transmitted to Qure.ai software 'qXR' for interpretation. Images with features of cancer will be flagged as 'Urgent Suspicion of Cancer' and be prioritised for radiologist review within the existing reporting workflow.Ethics and dissemination The study will follow the principles of Good Clinical Practice. The protocol was granted REC approval in August 2023 from North West-Greater Manchester West Research Ethics Committee (REC 23/NW/0211). This study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06044454).

A comprehensive understanding of AI adoption patterns can reveal who is able to leverage this emerging technology and in what ways, providing insights into the future direction of AI applications and research collaboration. This study leverages the Microsoft Academic Graph, a massive bibliographic dataset with detailed subfield information, to investigate AI adoption patterns among researchers in various disciplines (18 non-AI disciplines ranging from the humanities and social sciences to STEM), career stages (early, mid, and senior), and the interactions between these two aspects from 2006 onwards. Our findings indicate that researchers in economics and business can play an important bridging role in AI-related collaborations between STEM and social science researchers, who currently exhibit substantial disparities in AI adoption patterns. Late early-career to early mid-career researchers tend to adopt AI more actively than others, although this pattern varies across disciplines.

Relying on variation analysis and correlation analysis methods, it has been substantiated that environmental management have significant impact on companies from the perspective of social LCA, which has an impact on the competitive ability of companies. Relying on the IPAT-method, it has been proven that technology is a key factor which determines this impact. As a result, it has been proved on the example of the case experience of the largest energy companies in Russia in 2022 that the environmental management of oil and gas companies creates advantages not only for the environment but also for financial efficiency and stability (break-even operation) of these companies (implementation of SDG 8). Using the example of the international experience of energy companies (from the UAE, Sweden, the UK, the USA and Japan), it has been proved that AI can play a much greater role in the oil and gas markets, contributing not only to ensuring a deficit-free energy economy (the implementation of SDG 7) but also to environmental protection (the implementation of SDGs 13-15). The best practices of using AI in each selected sector of the oil and gas industry were studied and a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the benefits of AI was carried out. Thirdly, the most promising use of AI in the sector of environmental management for environmental economics and management is substantiated. It is proven that the options for environmental management can be different and specific to a particular object. Thanks to the results obtained in the course of the study, a systematic view of the prospects for the sustainable development of oil and gas markets has been formed, and the importance of AI for this process has been demonstrated. The theoretical significance of the study consists in expanding the existing understanding of the use of AI in the practice of environmental management of energy companies and clarifying its contribution to the implementation of the SDGs.",,,,,"??????????, ??????????/AAU-4068-2021; Seregina, Antonina/ACL-6272-2022","Kuprianova, Ludmila/0000-0002-9453-6425",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-665X,,,,SEP 6,2022,10,,,,,,,,952102,10.3389/fenvs.2022.952102,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.952102,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000860327300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Algae biorefineries offer a promising solution to these challenges. However, the high production and downstream processing costs continue to hinder successful commercialization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of several AI-driven innovations: phenotypic screening for strain improvement, monitoring of environmental parameters, machine learning for optimizing dewatering efficiency, predictive modeling for algae growth and yield, and AI-controlled drying systems for biomass preservation.Recent FindingsIntegrating machine learning algorithms and predictive modeling can transform algae cultivation by automating the process with continuous monitoring and feedback systems, significantly reducing labor costs while enhancing process economics and efficiency. Accurate prediction of optimal harvesting times can further decrease harvesting costs, address key scalability issues, and facilitate the broader commercialization of algae for diverse biotechnological applications.SummaryIn the future, smart biorefineries that integrate artificial intelligence into algae production facilities will be pivotal in enhancing process efficiency and economics within circular and sustainable frameworks.

Using the math in environmental economics helps to determine and describe the most important connections. There are three main phases of mathematical modeling: 1. Defining goals and objectives of the research, describing of the object in the form of economic model. 2. Formulating the mathematical model of the studied object. 3. Data processing and analyzing. Modern methods of optimization are often treated with the help of high-level mathematics. At the same time, there are quite simple algorithms for finding the minimum (maximum) of the function. A description of the sequence of actions in the algorithmic language with elements of mathematics provides a big degree of freedom for the programmer, leaving behind him an opportunity of independent choice of programming language. For solving optimization problems programmer mathematician must consider the real opportunities of computer taking into account specifies of the algorithm. In optimization theory, there are three main classes of problems: unconstrained optimization; constrained optimization problem; optimization problems with incomplete data. Depending on the type of function, which will be optimized isolated linear programming problem and a convex programming problems (in these tasks f and X are convex). The most effective algorithms for non-convex multi-extermal and discrete optimization problems have not found yet. Practical examples of nonlinear programming problems are widespread in economic activity. Gradient projection method is not devoid of features and the specific application. Nevertheless, using of this algorithm is effective respect to a convex programming problem, where the system of conditions appears as a rather simple convex set. Among the many modern programming languages, one of the most convenient for scientific computing is a scripting language Python. Language is similar to MATLAB and good for programming mathematical calculations. And Python is able to work with languages such as Fortran, C and C ++ which are already widely used in scientific calculations. There are a large number of modules written in Python, which simplify the process of calculating (NumPy, SymPy and others).",,,,,"Turygina, Victoria/ABA-1487-2021; Vasilev, Julian/E-1244-2017","Vasilev, Julian/0000-0002-6146-746X; Petrova, Desislava/0000-0001-8007-2490; Turygina, Victoria/0000-0001-5357-6589",,,,,,,,,,,,,1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,,,,2016,,,,,,,349,355,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391520200045,View Full Record in Web of Science
