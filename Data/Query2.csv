The majority of NIL algorithms is industry-neutral and business process agnostic. ML innovation is propelled by publicly available research, which gets harvested into Open Source for wide distribution through software and Cloud vendors. Ongoing Al technology work creates an immense source of assets for data-driven modeling, delivered as software libraries. However, the application of these assets for data monetization in finance does not happen with nearly comparable success or speed. The latter challenge is commonly known as the scalability problem of AI. As new techniques continue to grow vigorously, the investment from large finance institutions to cost-effectively produce applications for a variety of lines-of-business (LoBs) and business processes will increase. The availability of ML capabilities on Public (loud is a way for enterprises to increase productivity by benefiting from the best AI assets available from providers and startups. But data is constrained in terms of location, access and use in most finance competences by either laws or internal Governance, Risk and Compliance (CRC) rules. Legal limitations include, and go beyond, Privacy Acts, impacting non-retail processes where AI techniques must be explained in layperson language to decision-makers and regulators before field deployment. The latter is not yet achieved satisfactorily. Lastly, a large percentage of AI projects fail, in part due to unsuitable ML modeling for analytics and forecasting problems in finance. The variety and complexity of human behavior present in most finance processes calls for understanding AI at a level of cognitive depth that has no precedent in other industries. It is imperative that AI be approached so that finance competence and functional specificity are embedded a-priori into ML techniques and not as use-case afterthoughts. For acceleration of AI assessments, it is critical that ML techniques available in software implement models readily aligned to finance problems. This paper presents an approach to building an Architecture for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Finance by focusing on analytics and forecasting for business-to-business operations. This AI Architecture hinges on three axes and their interplay: Design Dimensions, Modeling Building-Blocks and Work-Practice. The goal is to support finance practitioners navigate the plethora of AI . options more effectively and accelerate data monetization. While ML techniques in data analytics and forecasting apply to many scenarios, this paper focuses on selected competences in Banking, Financial Markets and Chief Finance Officer (CFO) operations.

Quantitative data were gathered using the Synthetic Index of Use of AI Tools (SIUAIT) instrument, administered over three semesters. The findings revealed that finance students perceived AI tools as essential for enhancing their learning experience. Notably, Financial Engineering students exhibited higher proficiency and more positive perceptions of AI tools compared to students in other disciplines, such as Engineering and Business. An observational study utilizing eye tracker technology and facial expression analysis highlighted the emotional dynamics between AI-enhanced and traditional lecture-based classes. Positive emotions, such as joy and surprise, were significantly more prevalent in AI-enhanced environments, contributing to a more engaging and emotionally positive learning experience. However, an increase in fear was also observed, which could be considered a negative activating emotion that, ultimately, still fostered learning. Semi-structured interviews with educators revealed both the opportunities and challenges of AI integration. Educators acknowledged AI's benefits in enhancing pedagogy but expressed concerns about over-reliance and ethical implications. Thematic analysis identified key dimensions: knowledge, usage, and ethics in AI. The study concluded that AI tools could significantly transform finance education, offering enhanced learning experiences and better preparing students for future careers. However, a balanced approach, addressing ethical and psychological impacts, was essential to maximize benefits and minimize potential drawbacks. Future research should explore AI's long-term effects and its correlation with academic performance. PUBLIC INTEREST STATEMENT This study highlights how Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are shaping finance education by examining their effects on students' learning experiences, emotional responses, and educators' perspectives. AI tools, such as ChatGPT and FinChat, were shown to improve students' engagement and understanding, particularly in finance-related subjects. The study's findings suggest that students, especially in Financial Engineering, not only gain valuable skills but also experience increased positive emotions, like joy and surprise, during AI-enhanced classes. However, an observed rise in fear also indicated the importance of addressing emotional challenges in AI-driven learning. Educators viewed AI tools as beneficial for enhancing teaching but raised concerns about ethical considerations and over-reliance.

This research seeks to demonstrate how AI can enable the startup selection process for both entrepreneurs and investors in terms of video pitch evaluation.Design/methodology/approachAn AI startup (Speechannel) was used to predict the outcomes of startup video presentations by analyzing text, audio, and video data from 294 video pitches sent to a leading European startup accelerator (LUISS EnLabs). 7 investors were also interviewed in Silicon Valley to establish the differences between humans and machines.FindingsThis research proves that AI has profound implications with regards to the decision-making process related to fundraising and, in particular, the video pitches of startup accelerators and incubators. Successful entrepreneurs are confident (but not overconfident), engaging in terms of speaking quickly (but also clearly), and emotional (but not overemotional).Practical implicationsThis study not only fills the existing research gap but also provides a practical guide on AI-driven video pitch evaluation for entrepreneurs and investors, reshaping the landscape of entrepreneurial finance thanks to AI. On the one hand, entrepreneurs could use this knowledge to modify their behaviors, enabling them to increase their likelihood of being financially backed. On the other hand, investors could use these insights to better rationalize their funding decisions, enabling them to select the most promising startups.Originality/valueThis paper makes a significant contribution by bridging the gap between theoretical research and the practical application of AI in entrepreneurial finance, marking a notable advancement in this field. At a theoretical level, it contributes to research on managerial decision-making processes - particularly those related to the analysis of video presentations in a fundraising context. At a practical level, it offers a model that we called the AI-enabled video pitch evaluation, which is used to extract features from the video pitches of startup accelerators and incubators and predict an entrepreneurial project's success.",,,,,"Regenwetter, Lyle/JTJ-5972-2023; Pellegrini, Massimiliano/N-7178-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-1747,1758-6070,,,,2024 JUN 20,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/MD-10-2023-1926,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/MD-10-2023-1926,,JUN 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001249862700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In terms of market access, AI-driven analytics can identify consumer trends and competitive dynamics, enabling personalized marketing and overcoming linguistic and cultural barriers. Due to the lack of quantitative data, this study employed qualitative research methods, specifically a multiple-case-study approach. The case studies of leading companies such as Alibaba, DHL, and Maersk showcase how they leverage AI to optimize their trade operations, improve customer service, and achieve greater efficiency. These real-world examples demonstrate AI's practical applications and significant benefits in the global trade landscape. However, the adoption of AI in international trade is not without challenges. These include issues around data quality, ethical concerns, technological complexity, and public perception. Policy recommendations highlight the need for a robust data infrastructure, establishing ethical AI guidelines, and fostering international cooperation to align data protection regulations.",,,,,"Ozturk, Ozcan/AGS-6653-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2227-7099,,,,NOV,2024,12,11,,,,,,,298,10.3390/economies12110298,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/economies12110298,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001364321200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, some suggest an outright ban on AI development while others profess international agreement on constraining specific types of AI. These approaches are untenable because countries will continue developing AI for national defense, regardless. Some suggest having an all-powerful benevolent one-AI that will act as an AI nanny. However, such an approach relies on the everlasting benevolence of one-AI, an untenable proposition. Furthermore, such an AI is itself subject to capture by a rogue actor. We present an alternative approach that uses existing mechanisms and time-tested economic concepts of competition and marginal analysis to limit centralization and integration of AI, rather than AI itself. Instead of depending on international consensus it relies on countries working in their best interests. We recommend that through regulation and subsidies countries promote independent development of competing AI technologies, especially those with decentralized architecture. The Sherman Antitrust Act can be used to limit the domain of an AI system, training module, or any of its components. This will increase the segmentation of potent AI systems and force technological incompatibility across systems. Finally, cross-border communication between AI-enabled systems should be restricted, something countries like China and the US are already inclined to do to serve their national interests. Our approach can ensure the availability of numerous sufficiently powerful AI systems largely disconnected from each other that can be called upon to identify and neutralize rogue systems when needed.

AI can be applied in many different sectors, such as transportation, education, healthcare, banking, and finance, among many others. The financial industry is rapidly embracing AI due to its potential for high-cost savings in financial services. AI could transform the financial sector by creating opportunities for tailored, faster, and more cost-effective services. Saudi Arabia is emerging as a fast-growing market in this industry with a strong commitment to technology-driven institutions. While AI is gaining prominence and receiving government support, it has not yet become a critical component for enhancing the efficiency of financial transactions. Limited published research on AI adoption in the Saudi Arabian financial industry calls for a comprehensive literature review to examine the current state of AI implementation in this sector. Therefore, this study explores the benefits, limitations, and challenges of leveraging AI in finance, highlighting the importance of ethical and regulatory considerations for successful AI adoption in the sector. This study's findings reveal that research has been conducted on how AI improves processes in the financial sector by integrating critical components and efficient algorithms tailored to the industry's needs. Based on these findings, this study proposes a sequential framework at the macro and micro levels of management to guide AI's development and integration into the financial sector.

We generate DeFi-project TrustScore by aggregating multiple factors that provide DeFi investors with a holistic view of DeFi project trustworthiness. To rate a DeFi project with a TrustScore, we combine the output of four AI pipelines that analyze smart contract code vulnerabilities, suspicious transactions, anomalous price changes to smart contracts, and social media scam sentiment. Applying four factors exponentially improves the trust-score accuracy over the single-factor approaches done historically. Two of the factors, anomalous price change, and social media sentiment, have not been used before to detect DeFi fraud. Furthermore, we enhanced the most critical factor, smart-contract code vulnerability detection, with the latest Large Language Models (LLMs). Our overall system is a multi-model composed of a TrustScore Explainer LLM that aggregates individual pipeline results, a fine-tuned GPT model to audit smart contract code, the Prophet forecasting tool, FinBERT tailored for financial Natural Language Processing (NLP), and XGBoost for classification.

The finding indicates that digital finance has the ability to prevent corporate share price collapse, with the depth of digital finance usage exerting a significantly stronger effect compared to the breadth of digital finance coverage. Meanwhile, the results from the intrinsic mechanism analysis reveal that the information transparency, agency costs, and stock price synchronization act as mediating variables through which digital finance to inhibit the risk of stock price collapse. Furthermore, our empirical results reveal heterogeneity in the inhibitory effect of digital finance on the risk of stock price collapse among different types of enterprises. The aforementioned effect is significant for large-sized enterprises, state-owned enterprises, and enterprises operating in financially developed regions. However, it is not significant for small-sized enterprises, private enterprises, and enterprises in financially underdeveloped regions.

This legal research uses a statute approach, conceptual approach and comparative approach between Indonesia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).FindingsThe utilization of AI in Islamic finance is becoming increasingly important in various sectors. In the front office, AI simplifies credit evaluation, Takaful (Islamic insurance) and chatbots, improving client interactions and decision-making processes. In the middle office, AI is an integral part of anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing (CTF), know your customer protocols and fraud detection. In the back office, AI improves capital management, market impact assessment, risk management and asset and wealth management. In addition, AI substantially enhances regulatory technology (RegTech) and supervisory technology (SupTech), ultimately improving the effectiveness of regulatory compliance and supervision in the Islamic finance industry. These technologies simplify compliance processes, evaluate data quality, detect potential hazards and adapt to complex regulatory frameworks. Nonetheless, the incorporation of AI faces significant obstacles, most notably the absence of a comprehensive legal framework governing the application of AI in the Islamic finance industry. The current regulations, including the Islamic Banking Law and Insurance Law, do not adequately address AI. Moreover, the use of AI raises concerns about Shariah compliance, particularly about transparency and possible algorithmic bias in the decision-making process. The effectiveness of supervision in Islamic finance largely depends on the membership of the Islamic supervisory board, which must have technological expertise to ensure compliance withShariah norms. Therefore, the development of more sophisticated and effective supervisory procedures is essential for the proper implementation of AI in Islamic banking. An efficient supervisory framework should provide transparency, data security, regular auditing of AI systems and integration of RegTech and SupTech technologies within the Islamic finance sector.Research limitations/implicationsThis research examines the use of AI in the Islamic finance industry in Indonesia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the UAE.Practical implicationsThis research is important to mitigate the risks of using AI in the Islamic finance industry such as AI decision transparency and explanation, AI job transfer bias and AI conflict with Islamic finance principles.

Frameworks that incorporate feature engineering and green AI principles are used separately in both individual and hybrid approaches. The individual models are the commonly used regressor-based algorithms applied to business problems. The hybrid models first use k-Means to cluster customers, followed by the application of individual regressor-based models (e.g., decision trees, gradient boosting, and LightGBM). The present results show that using fewer features results in only a marginally lower accuracy compared to models with more features (a difference of approximate to 0.01 in MAE when comparing the use of 18 versus 85 features). Additionally, this article clearly demonstrate the trade-off between higher accuracy and longer computational time in hybrid ML models versus lower accuracy and shorter computational time in individual models when predicting customer loyalty.

In recent years, green finance (GF) has been recognized as a potential catalyst for fostering urban green economy and promoting urban sustainable development. This study thus explores whether GF stimulates artificial intelligence (AI) and energy efficiency (EE), thereby contributing to urban sustainable development. Leveraging 282 Chinese cities' datasets from 2014 to 2019, this study yields the following conclusions. This study evidences that GF contributes to the enhancement of the Chinese urban AI level. This conclusion holds true even when alternative measurements are considered, the instrumental variable (IV) method is employed, the interference of the GF policies is eliminated, the municipality samples are excluded, and doubly debiased Lasso regression is carried out. Additionally, the study highlights that the beneficial influence of GF on AI is notably significant in eastern and central cities, nonresource-dependent cities, cities with a population under 5 million, and low AI-level cities. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the positive effect of GF on EE and its spatial spillover effects. These findings help reinforce the role of GF in advancing urban sustainable development through enhancements in AI and EE.",,,,,"Zhang, Weike/AAE-8388-2022; Zeng, Ming/KXQ-9754-2024","Zeng, Ming/0009-0006-6400-0781",,,,,,,,,,,,,0140-9883,1873-6181,,,,NOV,2024,139,,,,,,,,107883,10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107883,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107883,,SEP 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001310840200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, established technology adoption theories offer limited tools for characterizing business AI integration and analyzing its effects. These primarily focus on the factors facilitating or hindering adoption, rather than on adoption patterns and impacts. This paper introduces a novel conceptual framework to address this key gap and applies it to the case of the ESG rating industry. ESG raters play a pivotal role in sustainable finance, providing metrics that guide investment decisions globally. However, little is known about the extent and nature of their AI usage and its implications. Through a mixed-methods approach combining the analysis of job postings, patent filings, research publications, and corporate websites, we examine AI adoption among major ESG raters. Our investigation explores the specific AI technologies employed, their functional applications, the innovations developed, the intensity of AI integration, and the potential impacts of raters' AI adoption. Our results reveal widespread and growing AI adoption across the industry. Our findings show that raters extensively leverage Natural Language Processing to streamline data collection, processing, and analysis. Furthermore, they have pioneered Machine Learning innovations that significantly expand their sustainability assessment capabilities in various domains. These findings mark a considerable departure from prior academic and gray literature that characterized major ESG raters as having minimal AI use, prompting critical questions regarding the implications of this technological transformation for ESG ratings' reliability, transparency, and potential biases.",,,,,"Sanchez Chaparro, Teresa/ABE-3798-2021","Suarez Giri, Felipe/0000-0002-2449-6421",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2572-3170,,,,DEC,2024,7,4,,,,,,,e70038,10.1002/bsd2.70038,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bsd2.70038,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001368885200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Uncertainty information may help users better leverage AI predictions, especially when combined with their domain knowledge. We conducted a human-subject experiment with an online sample to examine the effects of presenting uncertainty information with AI recommendations. The experimental stimuli and task, which included identifying plant and animal images, are from an existing image recognition deep learning model, a popular approach to AI. The uncertainty information was predicted probabilities for whether each label was the true label. This information was presented numerically and visually. In the study, we tested the effect of AI recommendations in a within-subject comparison and uncertainty information in a between-subject comparison. The results suggest that AI recommendations increased both participants' accuracy and confidence. Further, providing uncertainty information significantly increased accuracy but not confidence, suggesting that it may be effective for reducing overconfidence. In this task, participants tended to have higher domain knowledge for animals than plants based on a self-reported measure of domain knowledge. Participants with more domain knowledge were appropriately less confident when uncertainty information was provided. This suggests that people use AI and uncertainty information differently, such as an expert versus second opinion, depending on their level of domain knowledge.

Furthermore, to make use of AI's potential to pinpoint the key elements affecting GF development and investment, attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used. The links between GF, BC, and AI are analyzed and visualized using a novel method called the Financial Filtered Graph (FFG). The results of the study demonstrate that by increasing the precision of investment forecasts and identifying critical factors that affect GF growth, AI-driven solutions can greatly improve the sustainability of green finance strategies. The suggested methodology effectively supports sustainable investment decisions, as evidenced by its remarkable 98.8% classification accuracy. According to the findings, integrating AI and BC has a lot of potential to enhance green finance's accountability, transparency, and decision-making processes, all of which will support long-term economic and environmental sustainability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2071-1050,,,,MAR 13,2025,17,6,,,,,,,2520,10.3390/su17062520,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su17062520,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001453820500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, finance quantitative modeling with conventional supervised learning approaches has a number of limitations, including the difficulty in defining appropriate labels, lack of consistency in modeling and trading execution, and lack of modeling the dynamic nature of the finance market. The development of deep reinforcement learning techniques is partially addressing these issues. Unfortunately, the steep learning curve and the difficulty in quick modeling and agile development are impeding finance researchers from using deep reinforcement learning in quantitative trading. In this paper, we propose an RLOps in finance paradigm and present a FinRL-Podracer framework to accelerate the development pipeline of deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven trading strategy and to improve both trading performance and training efficiency. FinRL-Podracer is a cloud solution that features high performance and high scalability and promises continuous training, continuous integration, and continuous delivery of DRL-driven trading strategies, facilitating a rapid transformation from algorithmic innovations into a profitable trading strategy. First, we propose a generational evolution mechanism with an ensemble strategy to improve the trading performance of a DRL agent, and schedule the training of a DRL algorithm onto a GPU cloud via multi-level mapping. Then, we carry out the training of DRL components with high-performance optimizations on GPUs. Finally, we evaluate the FinRL-Podracer framework for a stock trend prediction task on an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD cloud. FinRL-Podracer outperforms three popular DRL libraries Ray RLlib, Stable Baseline 3 and FinRL, i.e., 12% similar to 35% improvements in annual return, 0.1 similar to 0.6 improvements in Sharpe ratio and 3x similar to 7x speed-up in training time.

The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was extended by incorporating three additional constructs: subjective norms, which capture the social influence of close relationships, including family and friends; personal innovativeness, which reflects the openness to new technologies that is characteristic of Generation Z; and perceived trust, which addresses concerns related to security and reliability that are critical in financial contexts, thereby enhancing our understanding of this phenomenon among Generation Z. A survey of 292 Generation Z respondents was collected and structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed for data analysis. The findings of the study reveal that factors such as perceived usefulness, attitude, subjective norms, personal innovativeness, and perceived trust all have a significantly positive impact on Generation Z's intention to use AI-enabled VAs in banking. Additionally, the results indicate that perceived usefulness is influenced by ease of use, while attitude is affected by ease of use, perceived usefulness, personal innovativeness, and trust. Despite the Saudi government's support and initiatives for the development of the AI-fintech industry, there is still a lack of understanding about consumer behavioral intention toward AI-enabled VAs in Saudi Arabia and, particularly among Generation Z.

This shows the imperative need to contribute to making citizens insightful actors in debates and decisions involving the adoption of AI mechanisms. Currently, existing approaches to the teaching of basic AI concepts through programming treat machine intelligence as an external element/module. After being trained, that external module is coupled to the main application. Combining block-based programming and WiSARD weightless artificial neural networks, this article presents the conceptualization and design of a new methodology, AI from concrete to abstract (AIcon2abs), to endow general people (including children) with a minimum understanding of what AI means. The main strategy adopted was to include AI training and classification primitives as blocks that compose an otherwise conventional computer program. This way, the programmer can use these blocks as he/she uses other programming constructs. In order to achieve this purpose, we also propose BlockWiSARD, a block-based programming environment designed to promote the demystification of artificial intelligence via practical activities related to the development of learning machines, as well as through the observation of their learning process.

As AI systems are being adopted in more high-stakes areas such as medicine and finance, ensuring that they are trustworthy is of increasing importance. A concern that is prominently addressed by the development and application of explainability methods, which are purported to increase trust from its users and wider society. While an increase in trust may be desirable, an analysis of literature from different research fields shows that an exclusive focus on increasing trust may not be warranted. Something which is well exemplified by the recent development in AI chatbots, which while highly coherent tend to make up facts. In this contribution, we investigate the concepts of trust, trustworthiness, and user reliance. In order to foster appropriate reliance on AI we need to prevent both disuse of these systems as well as overtrust. From our analysis of research on interpersonal trust, trust in automation, and trust in (X)AI, we identify the potential merit of the distinction between trust and distrust (in AI). We propose that alongside trust a healthy amount of distrust is of additional value for mitigating disuse and overtrust. We argue that by considering and evaluating both trust and distrust, we can ensure that users can rely appropriately on trustworthy AI, which can both be useful as well as fallible.",,,,,,"Visser, Roel/0009-0006-3067-5545; Peters, Tobias Martin/0009-0008-5193-6243",,,,,,,,,,,,,1865-0929,1865-0937,978-3-031-44069-4; 978-3-031-44070-0,,,,2023,1903,,,,,,301,317,,10.1007/978-3-031-44070-0_15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-44070-0_15,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001286485700015,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aims to empirically examine the XAI related aspects faced by developers, users, and managers of AI systems during the development process of the AI system. To this end, a multiple case study was conducted in two Dutch financial services companies using four use cases. Our findings reveal a wide range of aspects that must be considered during XAI implementation, which we grouped and integrated into a conceptual model.

Additionally, the growth of urban populations is linked to a 0.14% increase in CO2 emissions from mining, underscoring the imperative of sustainable urban development. Moreover, the development of information and communication technology (ICT) shows promise, correlating with a 0.50% reduction in CO2 emissions, highlighting the role of technology in promoting sustainability. However, GDP growth is associated with a 0.04% increase in emissions, emphasizing the challenge of balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility. To advance sustainability, Asian economies should concentrate on expanding the green finance market, enhancing digitalization, employing AI for efficient green financial tools, and promoting green power generation in urban areas.",,,,,,"Gu, Weiyu/0009-0001-7338-8363",,,,,,,,,,,,,0301-4207,1873-7641,,,,JAN,2024,88,,,,,,,,104473,10.1016/j.resourpol.2023.104473,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2023.104473,,DEC 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001138348000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using the method of coupling coordination analysis, it measures the coordination status of 30 provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions) in China. The findings show that only 7 provinces are in a coordinated state, while the remaining 23 provinces are in a disordered state. To address this general lack of coordination, we analyze the direct and indirect mechanisms of artificial intelligence (AI) based on its principles of operation and conduct empirical tests. In the empirical analysis, we measure the level of AI innovation development using patent data from the Qizhidao Database and the level of AI technology application using data on industrial robot penetration from the International Federation of Robotics. We employ panel data at the provincial level from 2010 to 2019 and conduct least squares regression tests on the direct and indirect effects of AI.

Methods: Bibliometric analysis is also adopted in the research in order to study global publication trends, citation networks, as well as key contributors in e-business as well as in sustainable finance. The research employs a vast data collection gathered from Scopus that investigates over 459 research studies between 2000 and 2024. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is also adopted in order to rank drivers that have been identified from a vast literature review. Results: Results indicate that the USA, UK, and China are leading in terms of publication as well as authoring. Social sustainability is seen as prioritized followed by technological sustainability, with least prioritized as governance sustainability. AI, blockchain, and IoT have been identified as drivers in e-business as well as finance as a means towards technological advancement. Discussion: Integrating e-business with sustainable finance holds high promise for innovative, sustainable finance solutions. The study calls for more empirical studies with structural equation models and other decision models that can be adopted in order to foster digital business model sustainability. The study also brings into perspective digital strategy convergence with sustainability challenges in order to enhance growth in the long term.",,,,,"Sayal, Anu/AAU-7906-2020; ahmad, vasim/HNS-6687-2023; Arora, Madhu/ADT-5718-2022","Arora, Madhu/0000-0001-6015-6945",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2624-9634,,,,MAR 10,2025,7,,,,,,,,1549874,10.3389/frsc.2025.1549874,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frsc.2025.1549874,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001450511600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this context, the recent article introduces artificial intelligence (AI) as a new driver of economic cycles and analyzes its dynamic role alongside the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Paris Agreement (PA), green finance (GB), and economic shocks (ES) in determining global economic cycles. The article employs novel econometric tools, namely the CAViaR-TVP-VAR model, the Quantile Coherence method, panel Quantile on Quantile Kernel-Based Regularized Least Squares (PQQKRLS), and the Quantile-Quantile Granger causality (QQGC) test for robust findings. The outcomes reveal that AI influences economic cycles in the short run while significantly mitigating these cycles in the medium and long run. Furthermore, the BRI exhibits a positive link with economic cycles during the short and medium run; however, it can contribute to economic stability in the long run by impeding economic fluctuations. Similarly, green finance and the PA show mixed influences across various time horizons, except for the long run, which confirms their negative association with economic cycles. Additionally, ES has a direct link with economic cycles across most periods. The robustness check based on the QQGC test and PQQKRLS method supports the main results. Our results identify AI, BRI, and the PA as new drivers of economic cycles with the potential to counter global economic cycles. Therefore, based on these findings, the study proposes several policy implications tailored to different time horizons.",,,,,"Chishti, Muhammad Zubair/AAP-1992-2020; Binsaeed, Rima/KPY-2671-2024; DOGAN, Eyup/J-8676-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0040-1625,1873-5509,,,,DEC,2024,209,,,,,,,,123740,10.1016/j.techfore.2024.123740,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2024.123740,,SEP 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001312257900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using generative AI (ChatGPT 4.0), responses were simulated to mimic CBDC adoption scenarios, considering demographic attributes, such as gender, income, education, age, level of financial literacy, network effect, media influence, and merchant acceptance. A total of 663 synthetic responses were generated and analyzed using statistical methods and multinomial logistic regression to assess the probability of acceptance, rejection, or waiting for more information to decide. The chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID) model showed a high performance in correctly classifying cases of acceptance, indecision, and rejection, presenting an accuracy of 92.6%. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that factors, such as educational level, financial experience, and income level, significantly influence the decision to accept a CBDC. This method also shows a high performance, as it obtained an accuracy of 96.4%. These results are in line with previous research and underline the effectiveness of generative AI as a reproducible and low-cost tool for analyzing hypothetical scenarios. Generative AI, with its algorithmic fidelity, has great potential for predicting human behavior in economic contexts. However, synthetic data may not capture the complexities and nuances of actual human decision making.

To date there are no standardised metrics that can ensure an overall assessment of the trustworthiness of AI applications in finance. To fill the gap, we propose a set of integrated statistical methods, based on the Lorenz Zonoid tool, that can be used to assess and monitor over time whether an AI application is trustworthy. Specifically, the methods will measure Sustainability (in terms of robustness with respect to anomalous data), Accuracy (in terms of predictive accuracy), Fairness (in terms of prediction bias across different population groups) and Explainability (in terms of human understanding and oversight).

However, it is difficult to capture and predict the impacts of AI technologies on companies' stock prices through traditional financial factors. Moreover, common information sources such as company's earnings calls and news are not enough to quantify and predict the actual AI premium for a certain company. In this paper, we utilize scholar data as alternative data for trading strategy development and propose a practical machine learning approach to quantify the AI premium of a company and capture the scholar data driven alpha in the AI industry. First, we collect the scholar data from the Microsoft Academic Graph database, and conduct feature engineering based on AI publication and patent data, such as conference/journal publication counts, patent counts, fields of studies and paper citations. Second, we apply machine learning algorithms to weight and re-balance stocks using the scholar data and traditional financial factors every month, and construct portfolios using the buy-and-hold-long only strategy. Finally, we evaluate our factor and portfolio in terms of factor performance and portfolio's cumulative return.

AI also has strong synergy with the information privacy (IP) domain from two distinct aspects: as a protection tool (i.e., safeguarding privacy), and as a threat tool (i.e., compromising privacy). In the former case, AI techniques are amalgamated with the traditional anonymization techniques to improve various key components of the anonymity process, and therefore, privacy is safeguarded effectively. In the latter case, some adversarial knowledge is aggregated with the help of AI techniques and subsequently used to compromise the privacy of individuals. To the best of our knowledge, threats posed by AI-generated knowledge such as synthetic data (SD) to information privacy are often underestimated, and most of the existing anonymization methods do not consider/model this SD-based knowledge that can be available to the adversary, leading to privacy breaches in some cases. In this paper, we highlight the role of AI as a threat tool (i.e., AI used to compromise an individual's privacy), with a special focus on SD that can serve as background knowledge leading to various kinds of privacy breaches. For instance, SD can encompass pertinent information (e.g., total # of attributes in data, distributions of sensitive information, category values of each attribute, minor and major values of some attributes, etc.) about real data that can offer a helpful hint to the adversary regarding the composition of anonymized data, that can subsequently lead to uncovering the identity or private information. We perform reasonable experiments on a real-life benchmark dataset to prove the pitfalls of AI in the data publishing scenario (when a database is either fully or partially released to public domains for conducting analytics).",,,,,"Majeed, Abdul/JHT-0587-2023; Majeed, Abdul/W-7578-2019","Majeed, Abdul/0000-0002-3030-5054",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-3536,,,,,,2023,11,,,,,,76177,76195,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3297646,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3297646,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001040724700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

AI agents play a vital role in facilitating complex decision making and improving operational efficiency in blockchain systems. This collaborative synergy is particularly evident in how multi-agent systems collectively tackle complex tasks to ensure seamless integration within these frameworks. While significant efforts have been made to integrate AI agents and blockchain, most studies overlook the broader potential of AI agents in addressing challenges such as interoperability, scalability, and privacy issues. In this paper, we bridge these gaps by illustrating the interplay between AI agents and blockchain. Specifically, we explore how AI agents enhance decentralized systems and examine blockchain's role in enabling secure and scalable collaboration. Furthermore, we categorize practical applications across domains, such as Web3, decentralized finance (DeFi), asset management, and autonomous systems, providing practical insights and real-world use cases.

Despite the increasing attention given to the Circular Economy (CE), currently, scholarly analysis is absent into the function of finance and the prospective utility of financial developments in expediting the adoption of CE principles. Through a systematic literature review (SLR), this research aims to present a comprehensive understanding of the nexus between finance and the CE, emphasising how financial innovations can accelerate the transition towards CE. Considering 150 articles, it was found that financial innovation is a powerful driver for the transition towards a CE. Indeed, financial innovation enables organisations to integrate CE principles and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) elements into their strategic decision-making. This research unveils the need for more research and innovation in the financial sector to develop advanced financial instruments and mechanisms that can support CE acceleration. The acceleration of the global transition towards a sustainable, resource-efficient, and resilient economic model that benefits enterprises and society can be facilitated by promoting financial innovations. The analysis is grounded on the idea of CE as based on the tenets of designing out waste and pollution, keeping materials and resources in use, and regenerating natural systems. It turns out that CE is affected by a variety of factors with a final result of positive impact on the environment and society: green bonds, green loans, and finance; pay-forperformance and results-based financing mechanisms; specialised financing solution/CE-focused funds and investment strategies; and fintech in driving the CE.

It does so by developing a novel multi-task learning framework combining aspect-based sentiment analysis, co-reference resolution, and contrastive learning to extract nuanced insights from a large corpus of social media data. Our approach integrates state-of-the-art models, including the SenticNet API, for sentiment analysis and implements multiple XAI methods such as LIME, SHAP, and Permutation Importance to enhance interpretability. Results reveal predominantly positive sentiment towards environmental topics, with notable variations across ESG categories. The contrastive learning visualization demonstrates clear sentiment clustering while highlighting areas of uncertainty. This research contributes to the field by providing an interpretable, trustworthy AI system for ESG sentiment analysis, offering valuable insights for policymakers and business stakeholders navigating the complex landscape of sustainable finance and climate action. The methodology proposed in this paper advances the current state of AI in ESG and green finance in several ways.

However, there is a steep development curve for quantitative traders to obtain an agent that automatically positions to win in the market, namely to decide where to trade, at what price and what quantity, due to the error-prone programming and arduous debugging. In this paper, we present the first open-source framework FinRL as a full pipeline to help quantitative traders overcome the steep learning curve. FinRL is featured with simplicity, applicability and extensibility under the key principles, full-stack framework, customization, reproducibility and hands-on tutoring. Embodied as a three-layer architecture with modular structures, FinRL implements fine-tuned state-of-the-art DRL algorithms and common reward functions, while alleviating the debugging workloads. Thus, we help users pipeline the strategy design at a high turnover rate. At multiple levels of time granularity, FinRL simulates various markets as training environments using historical data and live trading APIs. Being highly extensible, FinRL reserves a set of user-import interfaces and incorporates trading constraints such as market friction, market liquidity and investor's risk-aversion. Moreover, serving as practitioners' stepping stones, typical trading tasks are provided as step-by-step tutorials, e.g., stock trading, portfolio allocation, cryptocurrency trading, etc.",,,,,"Liu, Xiao-Yang/AAZ-8384-2020; Gao, Jiechao/AAV-1830-2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-4503-9148-1,,,,2021,,,,,,,,,,10.1145/3490354.3494366,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3490354.3494366,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000945933100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, investors of conventional energy assets have yet to consider the rapidly emerging AI-based assets for diversification. Owing to the rise of new categories of assets in the last two decades, which has sparked the interest of global investors to attain the most favorable outcomes, we examine volatility connectedness between AI stocks (MSFT-Microsoft, GOOG-Alphabet, AMZN-Amazon), AI tokens (AGIX-SingularityNET, OCEAN-Ocean Protocol, FET-Fetch.ai), and fossil fuel markets (WTI, BRENT, and GAS-natural gas) over the period from May 6, 2019, to July 8, 2023. We apply a novel three-dimensional framework in which we model time-domain and frequency-domain volatility spillovers at the median-, lower- and upper-quantiles in static as well as dynamic settings to achieve the objectives of this paper. We find the variation in static and dynamic connectedness between markets over timefrequencies and quantiles. Results reveal that AGIX, BRENT, FET, MSFT, and WTI are recipients, whereas AMZN, GAS, GOOG, and OCEAN are transmitters of the spillovers at the median quantile. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the short-term and long-term metrics for dynamic total connectedness might not consistently exhibit the same direction. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the short-term fluctuations predominantly influence the network's overall shock transmission, while the longer-term aspect has the potential to alter the role of a net transmitter or receiver of shocks. These findings provide portfolio managers, regulators, and policymakers with valuable information regarding portfolio adjustments, hedging, and financial stability.",,,,,"Yousaf, Imran/AAE-1107-2019; Umar, Muhammad/AFG-9168-2022; Li, Yanshuang/HLX-1180-2023","Li, Yanshuang/0000-0001-6218-7462; Yousaf, Imran/0000-0003-1968-293X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0140-9883,1873-6181,,,,MAY,2024,133,,,,,,,,107490,10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107490,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107490,,APR 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001217174800001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Zhao, JC",,,,"Zhao, Jingchen",,,Promoting more accountable AI in the boardroom through smart regulation,COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper focuses on the benefits that accountable artificial intelligence (AI) could bring to corporate boardrooms, and the role and format of regulation to promote more accountable AI. It will investigate the interconnections between AI, accountable decisions made by boards of directors in companies, the associated legal risks, and how to regulate AI to mitigate risks while promoting accountability. In the boardroom, AI is defined as the use of computers to assist, support, collaborate or even duplicate directors' behaviours. The last few years have seen increased calls for boards to have oversight responsibility at the intersection between AI and the regulatory and policy implications in a corporate setting. AI can be applied to advance the effectiveness and efficiency of corporate governance and to raise awareness of accountable practice in its standardisation and implementation. However, AI can also be a disruptive technology, and the accountable practice of AI needs to be reinforced by regulatory insight to enable its sustainable development. No consensus has yet been reached on the most appropriate regulatory framework to achieve these goals; this article therefore aims to identify the most appropriate regulatory framework to promote sustainable AI by monitoring and mitigating the associated risks in a corporate setting. We investigate the rationale for and advantages of a smart regulatory approach for regulating AI, aiming to achieve the participation of multi-disciplinary teams with members playing particular roles associated with the safe and effective deployment of AI.",,,,,"Zhao, Jincheng/JDD-1709-2023","ZHAO, Jingchen/0000-0003-0900-1352",,,,,,,,,,,,,2212-473X,2212-4748,,,,APR,2024,52,,,,,,,,105939,10.1016/j.clsr.2024.105939,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2024.105939,,JAN 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001175850200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

New AI algorithms are constantly emerging, with each 'strain' mimicking a new form of human learning, reasoning, knowledge, and decision-making. The current main disrupting forms of learning include Deep Learning, Adversarial Learning, Transfer and Meta Learning. Albeit these modes of learning have been in the AI/ML field more than a decade, they now are more applicable due to the availability of data, computing power and infrastructure. These forms of learning have produced new models (e.g., Long Short-Term Memory, Generative Adversarial Networks) and leverage important applications (e.g., Natural Language Processing, Adversarial Examples, Deep Fakes, etc.). These new models and applications will drive changes in future Capital Markets, so it is important to understand their computational strengths and weaknesses. Since ML algorithms effectively self-program and evolve dynamically, financial institutions and regulators are becoming increasingly concerned with ensuring there remains a modicum of human control, focusing on Algorithmic Interpretability/Explainability, Robustness and Legality. For example, the concern is that, in the future, an ecology of trading algorithms across different institutions may 'conspire' and become unintentionally fraudulent (cf. LIBOR) or subject to subversion through compromised datasets (e.g. Microsoft Tay). New and unique forms of systemic risks can emerge, potentially coming from excessive algorithmic complexity. The contribution of this paper is to review AI, ML and associated algorithms, their computational strengths and weaknesses, and discuss their future impact on the Capital Markets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-4503-7584-9,,,,2020,,,,,,,,,,10.1145/3383455.3422539,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3383455.3422539,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001467563200021,View Full Record in Web of Science

By integrating the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), it proposes a comprehensive model that elucidates the intricate relationships between social norms, attitude, perceived behavioral control, and the intention to accept AI advice, with a particular focus on examining risk tolerance as a moderating factor. A questionnaire survey was conducted with 569 Vietnamese investors to collect data in three different times. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was utilized to analyze the measurement model and test the hypotheses. Results indicate that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control positively influence the intention to accept AI advice. Furthermore, risk tolerance significantly moderates the link between attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intention to accept AI advice. This pioneering study introduces a comprehensive model unveiling the dynamics of AI advice acceptance in finance. It explores the novel concept of risk tolerance as a moderator, marking an important step in understanding human-AI interaction for financial decisions.

Academics and business leaders alike are eager to see this technology used in the financial industry, although its full potential and limitations are currently unknown. To bridge this knowledge gap, 3312 records from the Dimensions database were obtained between 2014 and 2022 and used for bibliometrics and network analysis on the subject of blockchain technology in the financial sector. This analysis articulates the various potentials of blockchain literature as well as its adoption by various countries and authors, collaboration patterns, and applications of blockchain in finance using the visual mapping technique provided by VOSviewer. The top two innovators in the field, China and the USA, have used blockchain more extensively in financial research. Furthermore, the results show that the coverage of blockchain in finance has exploded in the last three years. Although India ranks third in documentation, behind China and the USA, it is lacking in citations and networking opportunities. The results, which identify important journals and authors in this field, will aid future researchers in better understanding the literature and conducting a PRISMA-based systematic review.
